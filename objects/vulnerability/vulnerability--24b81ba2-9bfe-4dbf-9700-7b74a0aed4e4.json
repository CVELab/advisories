            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsch_htb: fix refcount leak in htb_parent_to_leaf_offload\n\nThe commit ae81feb7338c (\"sch_htb: fix null pointer dereference\non a null new_q\") fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug, but it\nis not correct.\n\nBecause htb_graft_helper properly handles the case when new_q\nis NULL, and after the previous patch by skipping this call\nwhich creates an inconsistency : dev_queue->qdisc will still\npoint to the old qdisc, but cl->parent->leaf.q will point to\nthe new one (which will be noop_qdisc, because new_q was NULL).\nThe code is based on an assumption that these two pointers are\nthe same, so it can lead to refcount leaks.\n\nThe correct fix is to add a NULL pointer check to protect\nqdisc_refcount_inc inside htb_parent_to_leaf_offload.",
