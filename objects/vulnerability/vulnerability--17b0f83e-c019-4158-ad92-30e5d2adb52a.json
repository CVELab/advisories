            "description": "In Point to MultiPoint (P2MP) scenarios within established sessions between network or adjacent neighbors the improper use of a source to destination copy write operation combined with a Stack-based Buffer Overflow on certain specific packets processed by the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved sent by a remote unauthenticated network attacker causes the RPD to crash causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
