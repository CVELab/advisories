            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()\"\n\nThis reverts commit 7c877586da3178974a8a94577b6045a48377ff25.\n\nAnders and Philippe have reported that recent kernels occasionally hang\nwhen used with NFS in readahead code.  The problem has been bisected to\n7c877586da3 (\"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to\ndo_page_cache_ra()\").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can be\nshrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up calling\ndo_page_cache_ra() with negative (read huge positive) number of pages. \nLet's revert 7c877586da3 for now until we can find a proper way how the\nlogic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This can\nlead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion but\nthat's better than outright hangs.",
