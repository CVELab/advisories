This vulnerability is due to improper deserialization of Java code within login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious login requests to the Cisco Webex Meetings service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary Java code and take arbitrary actions within the Cisco Webex Meetings application.",
