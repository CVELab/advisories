            "description": "\nAn authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the AOS-CX command line interface. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as a privileged user on the affected switch. This allows an attacker to fully compromise the underlying operating system on the device running AOS-CX.\n\n\n\n",
