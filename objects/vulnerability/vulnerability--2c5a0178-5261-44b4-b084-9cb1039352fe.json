The provided encrypt function is less secure when hex encoding and trimming are applied, leaving half of the bits in the key always the same for every encoded message or file.\r\r**Note:**\r\rIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to invest resources in preparing the attack and brute-force the encryption.",
