            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path\n\nIn es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function\ndirectly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the\nskb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other\nterms, this is a memory leak.\n\nThis patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and\nlet the function continue.\n\nIssue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for\ndetails.",
