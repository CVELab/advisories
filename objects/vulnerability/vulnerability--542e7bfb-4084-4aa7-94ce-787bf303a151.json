            "description": "A vulnerability in authentication mechanism of Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) on Cisco vManage could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the GUI of Cisco SD-AVC using a default static username and password combination. This vulnerability exists because the GUI is accessible on self-managed cloud installations or local server installations of Cisco vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the exposed GUI of Cisco SD-AVC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view managed device names, SD-AVC logs, and SD-AVC DNS server IP addresses.",
