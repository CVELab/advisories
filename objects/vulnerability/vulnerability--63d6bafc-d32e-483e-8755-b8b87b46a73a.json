            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: staging: rtl8192eu: Fix deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle\n\nThere is a deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle(), which is shown below:\n\n   (Thread 1)                |      (Thread 2)\n                             | _set_timer()\nrtw_joinbss_event_prehandle()|  mod_timer()\n spin_lock_bh() //(1)        |  (wait a time)\n ...                         | rtw_join_timeout_handler()\n                             |  _rtw_join_timeout_handler()\n del_timer_sync()            |   spin_lock_bh() //(2)\n (wait timer to stop)        |   ...\n\nWe hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread 1 and\nuse del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler\nalso need pmlmepriv->lock in position (2) of thread 2.\nAs a result, rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle() will block forever.\n\nThis patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of\nspin_lock_bh(), which could let timer handler to obtain\nthe needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() to\nspin_lock_irq() in _rtw_join_timeout_handler() in order to\nprevent deadlock.",
