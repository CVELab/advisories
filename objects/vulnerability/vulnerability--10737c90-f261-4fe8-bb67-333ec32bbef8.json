Using functionality within the application and a malicious host, it is possible to force the application to expose saved SSH/SFTP credentials. This can be done by using the application's editor to change the expected SFTP Host IP to a malicious host, and then using the Check Connectivity option. The application then sends these saved credentials to the malicious host.",
