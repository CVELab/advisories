            "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 2.3 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, anyone who can edit an arbitrary wiki page in an XWiki installation can gain programming right through several cases of missing escaping in the code for displaying sections in the administration interface. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. Normally, all users are allowed to edit their own user profile so this should be exploitable by all users of the XWiki instance. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. The patches can be manually applied to the `XWiki.ConfigurableClassMacros` and `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` pages.",
