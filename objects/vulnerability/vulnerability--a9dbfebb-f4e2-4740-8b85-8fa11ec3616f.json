            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_ncm: Fix UAF ncm object at re-bind after usb ep transport error\n\nWhen ncm function is working and then stop usb0 interface for link down,\neth_stop() is called. At this piont, accidentally if usb transport error\nshould happen in usb_ep_enable(), 'in_ep' and/or 'out_ep' may not be enabled.\n\nAfter that, ncm_disable() is called to disable for ncm unbind\nbut gether_disconnect() is never called since 'in_ep' is not enabled.\n\nAs the result, ncm object is released in ncm unbind\nbut 'dev->port_usb' associated to 'ncm->port' is not NULL.\n\nAnd when ncm bind again to recover netdev, ncm object is reallocated\nbut usb0 interface is already associated to previous released ncm object.\n\nTherefore, once usb0 interface is up and eth_start_xmit() is called,\nreleased ncm object is dereferrenced and it might cause use-after-free memory.\n\n[function unlink via configfs]\n  usb0: eth_stop dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200\n  --> error happens in usb_ep_enable().\n  NCM: ncm_disable: ncm=ffffff9b179c3200\n  --> no gether_disconnect() since ncm->port.in_ep->enabled is false.\n  NCM: ncm_unbind: ncm unbind ncm=ffffff9b179c3200\n  NCM: ncm_free: ncm free ncm=ffffff9b179c3200   <-- released ncm\n\n[function link via configfs]\n  NCM: ncm_alloc: ncm alloc ncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000\n  NCM: ncm_bind: ncm bind ncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000\n  NCM: ncm_set_alt: ncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000 alt=0\n  usb0: eth_open dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200  <-- previous released ncm\n  usb0: eth_start dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200 <--\n  eth_start_xmit()\n  --> dev->wrap()\n  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address dead00000000014f\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by checking if 'ncm->netdev' is not NULL at\nncm_disable() to call gether_disconnect() to deassociate 'dev->port_usb'.\nIt's more reasonable to check 'ncm->netdev' to call gether_connect/disconnect\nrather than check 'ncm->port.in_ep->enabled' since it might not be enabled\nbut the gether connection might be established.",
