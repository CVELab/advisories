An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to the ability of an attacker to perform an out-of-band XXE injection on the system, which could allow an attacker to capture customer files and redirect them to another destination address. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover sensitive customer data. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg36996.",
