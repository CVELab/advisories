            "description": "In OpenStack Nova before 27.4.1, 28 before 28.2.1, and 29 before 29.1.1, by supplying a raw format image that is actually a crafted QCOW2 image with a backing file path or VMDK flat image with a descriptor file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of the referenced file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Nova deployments are affected. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-47951 and CVE-2024-32498.",
