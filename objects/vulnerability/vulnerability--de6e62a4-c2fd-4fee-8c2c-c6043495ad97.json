            "description": "Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework. The cryptography implementation in Sliver up to and including version 1.5.39 allows a man in the middle (MitM) attack with access to the corresponding implant binary to execute arbitrary codes on implanted devices via intercepted and crafted responses. A successful attack grants the attacker permission to execute arbitrary code on the implanted device. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
