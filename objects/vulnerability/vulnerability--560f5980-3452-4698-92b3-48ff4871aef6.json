            "description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Bluetrum AB5301A devices with unknown firmware versions does not properly handle the reception of oversized DM1 LMP packets while no other BT connections are active, allowing attackers in radio range to prevent new BT connections (disabling the AB5301A inquiry and page scan procedures) via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually perform a power cycle (restart) of the device to restore BT connectivity.",
