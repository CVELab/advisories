The affected component can be abused to execute the malicious software inserted by the attacker with the elevated privileges of the component. This vulnerability results from the affected component searching for run-time artifacts outside of the installation hierarchy. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Rendezvous: versions 8.5.1 and below and TIBCO Rendezvous Developer Edition: versions 8.5.1 and below.",
