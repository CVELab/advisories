            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-write privileges on the application to perform a command injection attack that could result in remote code execution on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a remote shell with root privileges.",
