            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite or append arbitrary data to system files using root-level privileges. The attacker must have administrative credentials on the device. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of user input for a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with administrative privileges and issuing a CLI command with crafted user parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or append arbitrary data to system files using root-level privileges.",
