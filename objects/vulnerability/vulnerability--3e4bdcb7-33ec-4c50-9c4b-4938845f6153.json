            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param\n\nIn the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`\nstructure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is\nunlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this\npointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory\nthat has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.\n\nThis possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed\nby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.\n\nTo address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable\n`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is\nthen assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is\nsafely accessed.",
