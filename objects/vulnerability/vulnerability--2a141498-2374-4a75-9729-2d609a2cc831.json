            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings. An attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view device credentials that are normally not visible to Read-Only Administrators.",
