            "description": "The Wp Social Login and Register Social Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the counter_access_key_setup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update social login provider settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
