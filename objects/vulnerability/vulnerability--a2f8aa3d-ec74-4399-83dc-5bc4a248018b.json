            "description": "The MaxiBlocks: 2200+ Patterns, 190 Pages, 14.2K Icons & 100 Styles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the maxi_remove_custom_image_size and maxi_add_custom_image_size functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
