            "description": "The WP Prayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save() and export() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save plugin settings and trigger a data export via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
