            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"Revert \"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"\"\n\nA crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit\n2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"). The\nlatter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 (\"Revert \"block, bfq:\nhonor already-setup queue merges\"\"). Yet, the reverted commit was not\nthe one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF\nintroduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf\n(\"block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change\").\n\nSo, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq:\nhonor already-setup queue merges\") out. This commit restores it.\n\n[1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214503",
