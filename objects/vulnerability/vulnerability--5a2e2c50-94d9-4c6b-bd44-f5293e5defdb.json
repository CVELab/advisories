            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer\n\nThe TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the\nmaximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, it\ndoes not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data\nframe. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with\nKASAN.\n\nIntroduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the\ntransfer buffer.",
