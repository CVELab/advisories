            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4.0: Fix a use-after-free problem in the asynchronous open()\n\nYang Erkun reports that when two threads are opening files at the same\ntime, and are forced to abort before a reply is seen, then the call to\nnfs_release_seqid() in nfs4_opendata_free() can result in a\nuse-after-free of the pointer to the defunct rpc task of the other\nthread.\nThe fix is to ensure that if the RPC call is aborted before the call to\nnfs_wait_on_sequence() is complete, then we must call nfs_release_seqid()\nin nfs4_open_release() before the rpc_task is freed.",
