            "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoyâ€™s HTTP/2 codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server. In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and pending compressed header. The error return [code path] is taken if connection is already marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame. The clean-up code is right after the return statement, causing memory leak. Denial of service through memory exhaustion. This vulnerability was patched in versions(s) 1.26.3, 1.25.8, 1.24.9, 1.23.11.",
