            "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nIf an SRX Series device receives specific valid traffic destined to the device, it will cause the PFE to crash and restart.  Continued receipt and processing of this traffic will create a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:\n\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7.9,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5.3,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4.11,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3.\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS versions prior to 21.4R1 are not affected by this issue.",
