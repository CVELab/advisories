            "description": "On Juniper Networks Junos MX Series with service card configured, receipt of a stream of specific packets may crash the MS-PIC component on MS-MIC or MS-MPC. By continuously sending these specific packets, an attacker can repeatedly bring down MS-PIC on MS-MIC/MS-MPC causing a prolonged Denial of Service. This issue affects MX Series devices using MS-PIC, MS-MIC or MS-MPC service cards with any service configured. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: 17.2R2-S7; 17.3R3-S4, 17.3R3-S5; 17.4R2-S4 and the subsequent SRs (17.4R2-S5, 17.4R2-S6, etc.); 17.4R3; 18.1R3-S3, 18.1R3-S4, 18.1R3-S5, 18.1R3-S6, 18.1R3-S7, 18.1R3-S8; 18.2R3, 18.2R3-S1, 18.2R3-S2; 18.3R2 and the SRs based on 18.3R2; 18.4R2 and the SRs based on 18.4R2; 19.1R1 and the SRs based on 19.1R1; 19.2R1 and the SRs based on 19.2R1; 19.3R1 and the SRs based on 19.3R1.",
