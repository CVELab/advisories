            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first\n\nSetting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy\naccording, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while\nthe operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of\nthis behaviour.\n\nAadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags both\nin tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED\ncheck inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when\nthe lock is reserved.",
