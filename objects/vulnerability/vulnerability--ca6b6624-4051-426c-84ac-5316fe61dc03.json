            "description": "The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
