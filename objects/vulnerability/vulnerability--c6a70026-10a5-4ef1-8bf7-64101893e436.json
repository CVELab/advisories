NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the ActionServlet servlet, which allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the tempfilename parameter in a ReportImage action.",
