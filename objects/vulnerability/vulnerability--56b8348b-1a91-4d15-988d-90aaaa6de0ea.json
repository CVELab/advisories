            "description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the file upload section of imartinez/privategpt version 0.5.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted requests that could result in unauthorized access to the local network and potentially sensitive information. Specifically, by manipulating the 'path' parameter in a file upload request, an attacker can cause the application to make arbitrary requests to internal services, including the AWS metadata endpoint. This issue could lead to the exposure of internal servers and sensitive data.",
