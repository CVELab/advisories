            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal\n\nCurrently ioctl handlers are removed twice. For the first time during\niio_device_unregister() then later on inside\niio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().\nDouble free leads to kernel panic.\n\nFix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but rather\nletting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup\nroutine itself.",
