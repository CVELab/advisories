            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC IT LMS (All versions), SIMATIC IT Production Suite (Versions V7.1 < V7.1 Upd3), SIMATIC IT UA Discrete Manufacturing (Versions < V1.2), SIMATIC IT UA Discrete Manufacturing (Versions V1.2), SIMATIC IT UA Discrete Manufacturing (Versions V1.3), SIMATIC IT UA Discrete Manufacturing (Versions V2.3), SIMATIC IT UA Discrete Manufacturing (Versions V2.4). An attacker with network access to the installation could bypass the application-level authentication. In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must obtain network access to an affected installation and must obtain a valid username to the system. Successful exploitation requires no user privileges and no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.",
