            "description": "The LifterLMS â€“ WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Post Trashing due to a missing capability check on the delete_access_plan function and the related AJAX calls in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change status to \"Trash\" for every published post, therefore limiting the availability of the website's content.",
