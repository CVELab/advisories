            "description": "A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS handler of Cisco&nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling on established SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an SSL/TLS connection with the affected device and then sending a malicious SSL/TLS message within that connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
