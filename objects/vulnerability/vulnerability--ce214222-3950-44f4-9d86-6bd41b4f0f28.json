            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP camera. These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).",
