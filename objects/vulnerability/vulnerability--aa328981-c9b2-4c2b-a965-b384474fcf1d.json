This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a specific REST API output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, including administrative credentials for an external authentication server. Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid ERS administrative credentials.",
