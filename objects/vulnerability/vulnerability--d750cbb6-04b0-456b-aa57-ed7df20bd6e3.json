            "description": "DELL EMC Avamar Server, versions 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, contain an OS Command Injection Vulnerability in Fitness Analyzer. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS with high privileges. This vulnerability is considered critical as it can be leveraged to completely compromise the vulnerable application as well as the underlying operating system. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.",
