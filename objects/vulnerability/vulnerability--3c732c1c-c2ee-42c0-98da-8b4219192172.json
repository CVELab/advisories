            "description": "An issue was discovered in signmgr.dll 6.5.0.819 in Comodo Internet Security through 12.0. A DLL Preloading vulnerability allows an attacker to implant an unsigned DLL named iLog.dll in a partially unprotected product directory. This DLL is then loaded into a high-privileged service before the binary signature validation logic is loaded, and might bypass some of the self-defense mechanisms.",
