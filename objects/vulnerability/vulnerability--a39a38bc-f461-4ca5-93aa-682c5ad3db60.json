            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: tpm: Protect tpm_pm_suspend with locks\n\nCurrently tpm transactions are executed unconditionally in\ntpm_pm_suspend() function, which may lead to races with other tpm\naccessors in the system.\n\nSpecifically, the hw_random tpm driver makes use of tpm_get_random(),\nand this function is called in a loop from a kthread, which means it's\nnot frozen alongside userspace, and so can race with the work done\nduring system suspend:\n\n  tpm tpm0: tpm_transmit: tpm_recv: error -52\n  tpm tpm0: invalid TPM_STS.x 0xff, dumping stack for forensics\n  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: init Not tainted 6.1.0-rc5+ #135\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.0-20220807_005459-localhost 04/01/2014\n  Call Trace:\n   tpm_tis_status.cold+0x19/0x20\n   tpm_transmit+0x13b/0x390\n   tpm_transmit_cmd+0x20/0x80\n   tpm1_pm_suspend+0xa6/0x110\n   tpm_pm_suspend+0x53/0x80\n   __pnp_bus_suspend+0x35/0xe0\n   __device_suspend+0x10f/0x350\n\nFix this by calling tpm_try_get_ops(), which itself is a wrapper around\ntpm_chip_start(), but takes the appropriate mutex.\n\n[Jason: reworked commit message, added metadata]",
