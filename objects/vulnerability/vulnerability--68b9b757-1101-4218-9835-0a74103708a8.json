            "description": "On the iOS platform, the ThreatMetrix SDK versions prior to 3.2 fail to validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. ThreatMetrix is a security library for mobile applications, which aims to provide fraud prevention and device identity capabilities. The ThreatMetrix SDK versions prior to 3.2 do not validate SSL certificates on the iOS platform. An affected application will communicate with https://h-sdk.online-metrix.net, regardless of whether the connection is secure or not. An attacker on the same network as or upstream from the iOS device may be able to view or modify ThreatMetrix network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.",
