A specially crafted DICOM file can cause premature freeing of memory that is used later. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to induce the vulnerable application to process a malicious DICOM image.The Use-After-Free happens in the `parse_meta_sequence_end()` parsing the Sequence Value Represenations.",
