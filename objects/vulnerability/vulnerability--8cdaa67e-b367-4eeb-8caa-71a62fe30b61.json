There is a problem with current\nimplementation of page size calculation which is not considering\nthe offset in the calculation. This might lead to passing of\nimproper and out-of-bounds page size which could result in\nmemory issue. Calculate page start and page end using the offset\nadjusted address instead of absolute address.",
