The affected component can be abused to execute the malicious software inserted by the attacker with the elevated privileges of the component. This vulnerability results from a lack of access restrictions on certain files and/or folders in the installation. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO eFTL - Community Edition: versions 6.5.0 and below, TIBCO eFTL - Developer Edition: versions 6.5.0 and below, and TIBCO eFTL - Enterprise Edition: versions 6.5.0 and below.",
