            "description": "The Comments Extra Fields For Post,Pages and CPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several ajax actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. As a result, they may modify comment form fields and update plugin settings.",
