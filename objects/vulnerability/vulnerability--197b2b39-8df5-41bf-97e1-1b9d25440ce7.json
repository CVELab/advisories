            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix out-of-bounds write in trie_get_next_key()\n\ntrie_get_next_key() allocates a node stack with size trie->max_prefixlen,\nwhile it writes (trie->max_prefixlen + 1) nodes to the stack when it has\nfull paths from the root to leaves. For example, consider a trie with\nmax_prefixlen is 8, and the nodes with key 0x00/0, 0x00/1, 0x00/2, ...\n0x00/8 inserted. Subsequent calls to trie_get_next_key with _key with\n.prefixlen = 8 make 9 nodes be written on the node stack with size 8.",
