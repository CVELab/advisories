            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove()\n\nThis driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function\ndoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the\ntimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function\nhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.\n\nFix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler\nhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
