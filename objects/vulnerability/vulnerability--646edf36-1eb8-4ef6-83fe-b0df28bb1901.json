Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of IPv6 connections. The issue results from the lack of proper filtering of IPv6 SSH connections. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root.
