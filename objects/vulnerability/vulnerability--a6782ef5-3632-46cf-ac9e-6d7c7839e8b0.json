            "description": "Infinix devices contain a pre-loaded \"com.transsion.agingfunction\" application, that exposes an unsecured broadcast receiver. An attacker can communicate with the receiver and force the device to perform a factory reset without any Android system permissions. \n\nAfter multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer. We suppose this issue affects all Infinix Mobile devices.",
