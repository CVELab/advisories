Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of path strings. By inserting a null byte into the path, the user can skip most authentication checks. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-8616.",
