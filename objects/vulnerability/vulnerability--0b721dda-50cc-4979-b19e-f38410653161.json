            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2_25, and 1.3.1_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is for improper parsing of a crafted MIDI stream when creating a MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer to be corrupted and allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.",
