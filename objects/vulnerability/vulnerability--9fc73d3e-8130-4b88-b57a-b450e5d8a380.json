This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of multiple simultaneous device registrations on Cisco SSM On-Prem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple device registration requests to Cisco SSM On-Prem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.",
