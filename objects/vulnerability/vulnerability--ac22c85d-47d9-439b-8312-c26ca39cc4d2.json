SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V5.5.0), SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants) (all versions < 4.1.3). The device does not send the X-Frame-Option Header in the administrative web interface, which makes it vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker that is able to trick an administrative user with a valid session on the target device into clicking on a website controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform administrative actions via the web interface.",
