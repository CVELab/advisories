            "description": "KDDI +Message App, NTT DOCOMO +Message App, and SoftBank +Message App contain a vulnerability caused by improper handling of Unicode control characters. +Message App displays text unprocessed, even when control characters are contained, and the text is shown based on Unicode control character's specifications. Therefore, a crafted text may display misleading web links. As a result, a spoofed URL may be displayed and phishing attacks may be conducted. Affected products and versions are as follows: KDDI +Message App for Android prior to version 3.9.2 and +Message App for iOS prior to version 3.9.4, NTT DOCOMO +Message App for Android prior to version 54.49.0500 and +Message App for iOS prior to version 3.9.4, and SoftBank +Message App for Android prior to version 12.9.5 and +Message App for iOS prior to version 3.9.4",
