            "description": "P30 smart phones with versions earlier than ELLE-AL00B 9.1.0.193(C00E190R2P1) have an integer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient check on specific parameters. An attacker tricks the user into installing a malicious application, obtains the root permission and constructs specific parameters to the camera program to exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploit could cause the program to break down or allow for arbitrary code execution.",
