This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in the latest `stable` 2.7.8 version of Discourse. As a workaround users may ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.",
