            "description": "The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the permalink_setup function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the permalink structure via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While nonce verification is implemented, verification only takes place when a nonce is provided.",
