            "description": "Summary:\nMicrosoft was notified that an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows based systems supporting Virtualization Based Security (VBS) including a subset of Azure Virtual Machine SKUS; enabling an attacker with administrator privileges to replace current versions of Windows system files with outdated versions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities, circumvent some features of VBS, and exfiltrate data protected by VBS.\nMicrosoft is developing a security update to mitigate this threat, but it is not yet available. Guidance to help customers reduce the risks associated with this vulnerability and to protect their systems until the mitigation is available in a Windows security update is provided in the Recommended Actions section of this CVE.\nThis CVE will be updated when the mitigation is available in a Windows security update. We highly encourage customers to subscribe to Security Update Guide notifications to receive an alert when this update occurs.",
