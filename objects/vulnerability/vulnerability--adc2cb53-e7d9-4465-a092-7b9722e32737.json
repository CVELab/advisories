            "description": "An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf an attacker sends a specific MPLS packet, which upon processing, causes an internal loop, that leads to a PFE crash and restart. Continued receipt of these packets leads to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n \nCircuit cross-connect (CCC) needs to be configured on the device for it to be affected by this issue.\n\nThis issue only affects MX Series with MPC10, MPC11, LC9600, and MX304.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n21.4 versions from 21.4R3 earlier than 21.4R3-S5;\n22.2 versions from 22.2R2 earlier than 22.2R3-S2;\n22.3 versions from 22.3R1 earlier than 22.3R2-S2;\n22.3 versions from 22.3R3 earlier thanÂ 22.3R3-S1\n22.4 versions from 22.4R1 earlier than 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;\n23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2.\n\n\n",
