The search engine is affected by a SQL Injection, so any user able to perform lib/class/search.class.php searches (even guest users) can dump any data contained in the database (sessions, hashed passwords, etc.). This may lead to a full compromise of admin accounts, when combined with the weak password generator algorithm used in the lostpassword functionality.",
