            "description": "The uContext for Amazon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.9.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php file that is called via the doAjax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
