            "description": "A vulnerability in the 802.11r Fast Transition feature set of Cisco IOS Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a corruption of certain timer mechanisms triggered by specific roaming events. This corruption will eventually cause a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on the affected AP.",
