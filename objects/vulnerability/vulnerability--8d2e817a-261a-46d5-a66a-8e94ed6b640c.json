            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1\n\nRecently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:\n\nExpected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but\n    handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000\n    req == 0000000060f99b40\nnot ok 11 req_destroy works\n\nThis is because \"sock_release(sock)\" was replaced with \"fput(filp)\"\nto address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous\nbut fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.\n\nThe delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed\nbut handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()\nfollowed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy\nmethod. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the\nfinal close is complete before it checks the pointer.\n\nWe cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never\ncalled (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.\n\nReported by: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>",
