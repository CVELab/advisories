            "description": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the â€˜customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.",
