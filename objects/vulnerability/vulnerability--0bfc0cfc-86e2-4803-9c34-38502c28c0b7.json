            "description": "The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the\nactivation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs\nfrom attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious\npage elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before\nnavigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer\nextremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between when\nthe error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed.\nWith the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and \nactivate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.12, Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.",
