            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigation switch\n\nThe RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip the\ninterrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with\nthe interrupt exit code which tests that branch.\n\nInterrupt exit tests this condition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then\nagain in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recover\nthe MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exit\nagain. If the condition changes between these two tests, the MSR and irq\nsoft-mask state will become corrupted, leading to warnings and possible\ncrashes. For example, if the branch is initially true then false,\nMSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not get\nenabled, leading to warnings in irq_64.c.",
