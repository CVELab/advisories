When a user is editing any content type (e.g., page, post, or card) as an admin, the stored XSS payload is executed upon selecting a malicious text formatting option. NOTE: the vendor disputes the security relevance of this finding because \"any administrator that can configure a text format could easily allow Full HTML anywhere.\"",
