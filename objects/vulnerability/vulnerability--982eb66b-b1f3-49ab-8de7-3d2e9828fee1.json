            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: do asoc update earlier in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a\n\nThere's a panic that occurs in a few of envs, the call trace is as below:\n\n  [] general protection fault, ... 0x29acd70f1000a: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI\n  [] RIP: 0010:sctp_ulpevent_notify_peer_addr_change+0x4b/0x1fa [sctp]\n  []  sctp_assoc_control_transport+0x1b9/0x210 [sctp]\n  []  sctp_do_8_2_transport_strike.isra.16+0x15c/0x220 [sctp]\n  []  sctp_cmd_interpreter.isra.21+0x1231/0x1a10 [sctp]\n  []  sctp_do_sm+0xc3/0x2a0 [sctp]\n  []  sctp_generate_timeout_event+0x81/0xf0 [sctp]\n\nThis is caused by a transport use-after-free issue. When processing a\nduplicate COOKIE-ECHO chunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), both COOKIE-ACK\nand SHUTDOWN chunks are allocated with the transort from the new asoc.\nHowever, later in the sideeffect machine, the old asoc is used to send\nthem out and old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to is set to the transport\nthat SHUTDOWN chunk attached to in sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actually\nbelongs to the new asoc. After the new_asoc is freed and the old asoc\nT2 timeout, the old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to that is already freed\nwould be accessed in sctp_sf_t2_timer_expire().\n\nThanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig into this issue.\n\nTo fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first, then allocate\nthe COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated' old asoc. This\nwould make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc shouldn't be sent out\nwith another asoc. We had fixed quite a few issues caused by this.",
