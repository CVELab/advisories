            "description": "The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file modifications in versions up to, and including, 6.8 via the 'file' parameter which does not properly restrict files to be edited in the context of the plugin. This makes it possible with attackers, with high-level permissions such as an administrator, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that can be modified outside of the intended scope of the plugin.",
