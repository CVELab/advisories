            "description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl. \n\nWhen there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator, `S_do_trans_invmap` can overflow the destination pointer `d`.\n\n   $ perl -e '$_ = \"\\x{FF}\" x 1000000; tr/\\xFF/\\x{100}/;' \n   Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nIt is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service and possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.",
