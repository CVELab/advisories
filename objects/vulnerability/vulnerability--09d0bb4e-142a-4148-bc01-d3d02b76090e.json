All versions of lettersanitizer below 1.0.2 are affected by a denial of service issue when processing a CSS at-rule `@keyframes`. This package is depended on by [react-letter](https://github.com/mat-sz/react-letter), therefore everyone using react-letter is also at risk. The problem has been patched in version 1.0.2.",
