An attacker with network access to port 22/tcp and valid low-privileged user credentials for the target device could perform a privilege escalation and gain root privileges. Successful exploitation requires user privileges of a low-privileged user but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.",
