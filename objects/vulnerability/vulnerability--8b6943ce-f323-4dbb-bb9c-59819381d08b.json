            "description": "PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to version 8.1.3, the isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which makes it possible to store a cross-site scripting payload in the database. The impact is low because the HTML is not interpreted in BO, thanks to twig's escape mechanism. In FO, the cross-site scripting attack is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the customer session from which it was sent. This issue affects those who have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it without escaping HTML. Version 8.1.3 contains a patch for this issue.",
