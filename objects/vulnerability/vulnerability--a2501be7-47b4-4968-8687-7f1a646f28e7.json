            "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41 of the deno_runtime library, maliciously crafted permission request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name to the user. Version 1.41 of the deno_runtime library contains a patch for the issue.",
