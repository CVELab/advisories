            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allow\n\nThere are two issues around seqpacket_allow:\n1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is\n   created. Thus if features are never set, it will be\n   read uninitialized.\n2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,\n   then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately\n   (existing apps I know about don't usually do this but\n    it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies\n    on this).\n\nTo fix:\n\t- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation\n\t- set it unconditionally in set_features",
