            "description": "The Manage Bank Statements in SAP S/4HANA does not perform required access control checks for an authenticated user to confirm whether a request to interact with a resource is legitimate, allowing the attacker to delete the attachment of a posted bank statement. This leads to a low impact on integrity, with no impact on the confidentiality of the data or the availability of the application.",
