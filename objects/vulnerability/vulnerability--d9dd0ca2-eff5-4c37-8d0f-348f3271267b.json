An attacker can use these credentials to create authenticated and/or authorized requests. Note that the attacker must have \"root\" privilege access to the Android filesystem in order to exploit this vulnerability (i.e. the device has been compromised, such as disabling or bypassing Android's fundamental security mechanisms).",
