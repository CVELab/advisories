            "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Virtual Network Function (VNF) Element Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and run commands in the context of the root user on the server. The vulnerability is due to command settings that allow Cisco VNF Element Manager users to specify arbitrary commands that will run as root on the server. An attacker could use this setting to elevate privileges and run commands in the context of the root user on the server. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76670. Known Affected Releases: prior to 5.0.4 and 5.1.4.",
