A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges potentially could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files by creating a symlink from the \"Temp\\ICProgress\\Dell_InventoryCollector_Progress.xml\" to any targeted file. This issue occurs because permissions on the Temp directory were set incorrectly.",
