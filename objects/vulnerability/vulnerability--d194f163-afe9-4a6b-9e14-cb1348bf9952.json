            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory\n\nIgnore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits\n4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't\nenforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.\n\nIn the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result\nin an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a\nmemslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.\n\nPer the APM:\n\n  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer\n  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,\n  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.\n\nAnd the SDM's much more explicit:\n\n  4:0    Ignored\n\nNote, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow\nthat is broken.",
