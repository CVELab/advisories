            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information, conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device, or negatively impact the responsiveness of the web-based management interface itself. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information. A successful exploit could also cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker or consume memory resources to reduce the availability of the web-based management interface. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super Admin or Policy Admin credentials.",
