            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nss\n\nCurrently, if the access point receives an association\nrequest containing an Extended HE Capabilities Information\nElement with an invalid MCS-NSS, it triggers a firmware\ncrash.\n\nThis issue arises when EHT-PHY capabilities shows support\nfor a bandwidth and MCS-NSS set for that particular\nbandwidth is filled by zeros and due to this, driver obtains\npeer_nss as 0 and sending this value to firmware causes\ncrash.\n\nAddress this issue by implementing a validation step for\nthe peer_nss value before passing it to the firmware. If\nthe value is greater than zero, proceed with forwarding\nit to the firmware. However, if the value is invalid,\nreject the association request to prevent potential\nfirmware crashes.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
