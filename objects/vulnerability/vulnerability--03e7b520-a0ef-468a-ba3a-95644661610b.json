            "description": "Gotenberg provides a developer-friendly API to interact with powerful tools like Chromium and LibreOffice for converting numerous document formats (HTML, Markdown, Word, Excel, etc.) into PDF files, and more! Prior to version 8.1.0, the default value for the flag `--chromium-deny-list` allowed to display some internal files from the Gotenberg container. Version 8.1.0 provides a new default value fixing the issue. Prior to version 8.1.0, Gotenberg uses the standard `regexp` Go library, which does not support negative lookahead. Therefore, the new default value for the `--chromium-deny-list` is not applicable. However, one could find an alternative using either or both `--chromium-deny-list` and `--chromium-allow-list` flags. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
