IOW, we skb->data gets \"adjusted\" by a huge value.\n\nThe negative value is returned because skb->head and skb->data distance is\nmore than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) has wrapped around.\n\nThe bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can cause\ndev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.\n\nThe syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gre\ntunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)\ntunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.\n\nThis results in the following pattern:\n\n1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.\nRoute lookup found an output device, ipip0.\n\n2).\nip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0->needed_headroom based on the future\noutput device, rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0).\n\n3).\nip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the same\ncode path again (xmit recursion).\n\n4).\nRouting step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device\nto use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.\n\ntunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)\ngre0 device headroom.\n\nThis repeats for every future packet:\n\ngre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 step\nincremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0\nneeded_headroom was increased.\n\nFor each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows until\npost-expand-head reallocations result in a skb->head/data distance of\nmore than 64k.\n\nOnce that happens, skb->network_header (u16) wraps around when\npskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged\nafter the headroom expansion/reallocation.\n\nAfter this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)\nresult post headroom expansion.\n\nThe next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the\nnetwork header) makes skb->data point to a memory location outside\nskb->head area.\n\nv2: Cap the needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit to\nprevent perpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom increment\ncompletely.",
