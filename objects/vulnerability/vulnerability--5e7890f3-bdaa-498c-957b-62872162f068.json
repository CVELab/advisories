            "description": "The functions to fetch e-mail via POP3 or IMAP as well as sending e-mail via SMTP use OpenSSL for static SSL or TLS based communication. As the \nSSL_get_verify_result() function is not used the certificated is trusted always and it can not be ensured that the certificate \nsatisfies all necessary security requirements.\n\nThis could allow an \nattacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, \nuse expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be \ndetected if the certificate is properly validated.\n\nThis issue affects OTRS: from 7.0.X before 7.0.47, from 8.0.X before 8.0.37; ((OTRS)) Community Edition: from 6.0.X through 6.0.34.\n\n",
