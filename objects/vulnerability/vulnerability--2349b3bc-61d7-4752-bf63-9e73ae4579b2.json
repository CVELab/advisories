            "description": "A Reachable Assertion vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally-based, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, when a specific L2VPN command is run, RPD will crash and restart. Continued execution of this specific command will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\nAll versions prior to 19.3R3-S10;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S6;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S2;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2;\n22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2;\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\nAll versions prior to 20.4R3-S7-EVO;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3-EVO;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5-EVO;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4-EVO;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-EVO;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-EVO;\n22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-EVO;\n",
