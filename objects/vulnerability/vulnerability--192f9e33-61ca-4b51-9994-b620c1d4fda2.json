            "description": "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in OpenLLM version 0.6.10 allows attackers to include files from the local server through the web application. This flaw could expose internal server files and potentially sensitive information such as configuration files, passwords, and other critical data. Unauthorized access to critical server files, such as configuration files, user credentials (/etc/passwd), and private keys, can lead to a complete compromise of the system's security. Attackers could leverage the exposed information to further penetrate the network, exfiltrate data, or escalate privileges within the environment.",
