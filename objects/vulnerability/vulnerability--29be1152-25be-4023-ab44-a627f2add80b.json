            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference\n\nIf sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized,\nsd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference\nwhen sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing\nthe call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.\n\nThis change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage\nbecause the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when\nsd_revalidate_disk() is called, at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set,\nresulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk\nzone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().",
