            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious script code in a chat window. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
