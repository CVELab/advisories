            "description": "The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'azh_add_post', 'azh_duplicate_post', 'azh_update_post' and 'azh_remove_post' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify, and delete a post via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
