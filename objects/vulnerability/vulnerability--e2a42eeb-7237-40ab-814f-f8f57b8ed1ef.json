            "description": "A vulnerability in the filesystem permissions of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain read and write access to a critical configuration file. The vulnerability is due to a failure to impose strict filesystem permissions on the targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing and modifying restricted files. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use the content of this configuration file to bypass authentication and log in as any user of the device.
