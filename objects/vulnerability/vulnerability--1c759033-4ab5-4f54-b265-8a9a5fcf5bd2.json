            "description": "Users are able to read group conversations without actively taking part in them. Next to one to one conversations, users are able to start group conversations with multiple users. It was found possible to obtain the contents of these group conversations without being part of it. This could lead to information leakage where confidential information discussed in private groups is read by other users without the users knowledge.",
