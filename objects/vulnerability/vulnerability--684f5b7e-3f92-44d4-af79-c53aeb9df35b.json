            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business Routers RV042 Series could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.",
