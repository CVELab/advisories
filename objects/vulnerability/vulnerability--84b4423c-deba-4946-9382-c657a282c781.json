            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: roles: fix NULL pointer issue when put module's reference\n\nIn current design, usb role class driver will get usb_role_switch parent's\nmodule reference after the user get usb_role_switch device and put the\nreference after the user put the usb_role_switch device. However, the\nparent device of usb_role_switch may be removed before the user put the\nusb_role_switch. If so, then, NULL pointer issue will be met when the user\nput the parent module's reference.\n\nThis will save the module pointer in structure of usb_role_switch. Then,\nwe don't need to find module by iterating long relations.",
