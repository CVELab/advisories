This\ncauses devices registered with devm_spi_alloc_{master,slave}() to be\nmistakenly identified as legacy, non-devm managed devices and have their\nreference counters decremented below 0.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 660 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x108/0x174\n[<b0396f04>] (refcount_warn_saturate) from [<b03c56a4>] (kobject_put+0x90/0x98)\n[<b03c5614>] (kobject_put) from [<b0447b4c>] (put_device+0x20/0x24)\n r4:b6700140\n[<b0447b2c>] (put_device) from [<b07515e8>] (devm_spi_release_controller+0x3c/0x40)\n[<b07515ac>] (devm_spi_release_controller) from [<b045343c>] (release_nodes+0x84/0xc4)\n r5:b6700180 r4:b6700100\n[<b04533b8>] (release_nodes) from [<b0454160>] (devres_release_all+0x5c/0x60)\n r8:b1638c54 r7:b117ad94 r6:b1638c10 r5:b117ad94 r4:b163dc10\n[<b0454104>] (devres_release_all) from [<b044e41c>] (__device_release_driver+0x144/0x1ec)\n r5:b117ad94 r4:b163dc10\n[<b044e2d8>] (__device_release_driver) from [<b044f70c>] (device_driver_detach+0x84/0xa0)\n r9:00000000 r8:00000000 r7:b117ad94 r6:b163dc54 r5:b1638c10 r4:b163dc10\n[<b044f688>] (device_driver_detach) from [<b044d274>] (unbind_store+0xe4/0xf8)\n\nInstead, determine the devm allocation state as a flag on the\ncontroller which is guaranteed to be stable during cleanup.",
