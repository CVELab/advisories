Starting with version 1.8.0 and prior to versions 2.7.7 and 2.10.1, an authenticated user that has access to standard interface can craft an URL that can be used to execute a system command. Versions 2.7.7 and 2.10.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, delete the `ajax/dropdownContact.php` file from the plugin.",
