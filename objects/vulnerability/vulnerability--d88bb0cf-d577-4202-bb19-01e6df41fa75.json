            "description": "Tesla Model 3 bsa_server BIP Heap-based Buffer Overflow Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model 3 vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the bsa_server process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of an unprivileged user in a sandboxed process. Was ZDI-CAN-20737.",
