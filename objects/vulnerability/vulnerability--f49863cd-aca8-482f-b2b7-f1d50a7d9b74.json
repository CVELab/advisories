            "description": "A vulnerability in the ICMP ingress packet processing of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 4110 appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation upon receiving ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of crafted ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition that may result in an unexpected reload. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after the reload.",
