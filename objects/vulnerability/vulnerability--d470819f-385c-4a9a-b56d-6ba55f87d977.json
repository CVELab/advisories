            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.",
