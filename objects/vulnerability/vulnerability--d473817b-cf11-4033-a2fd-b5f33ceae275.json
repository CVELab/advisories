Prior to version 2.8.4 in the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` in the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, banner topic data is exposed on login-required sites. This issue is patched in version 2.8.4 in the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` in the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches of Discourse. As a workaround, one may disable banners.",
