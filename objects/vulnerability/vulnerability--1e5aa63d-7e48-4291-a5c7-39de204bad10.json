            "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s PDF Reader, version 11.1.0.52543. A specially-crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.",
