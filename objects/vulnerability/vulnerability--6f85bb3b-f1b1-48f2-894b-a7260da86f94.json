            "description": "The Tourfic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the tf_order_status_email_resend_function,  tf_visitor_details_edit_function, tf_checkinout_details_edit_function, tf_order_status_edit_function, tf_order_bulk_action_edit_function, tf_remove_room_order_ids, and tf_delete_old_review_fields functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to resend order status emails, update visitor/order details, edit check-in/out details, edit order status, perform bulk order status updates, remove room order IDs, and delete old review fields, respectively, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
