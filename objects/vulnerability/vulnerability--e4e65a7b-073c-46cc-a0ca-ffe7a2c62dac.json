            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list\n\nDetect gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) and\npass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the first\ncan segment them correctly.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify these skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For UDP, this\ncauses a NULL ptr deref in __udpv4_gso_segment_list_csum at\nudp_hdr(seg->next)->dest.\n\nDetect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size.\nDon't just drop, as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to be\nable to pass to regular skb_segment.",
