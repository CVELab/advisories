            "description": "Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. It is possible for an authenticated Sourcegraph user to edit the Code Monitors owned by any other Sourcegraph user. This includes being able to edit both the trigger and the action of the monitor in question. An attacker is not able to read contents of existing code monitors, only override the data. The issue is fixed in Sourcegraph 3.42. There are no workaround for the issue and patching is highly recommended.",
