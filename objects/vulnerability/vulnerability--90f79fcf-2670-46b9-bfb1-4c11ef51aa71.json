            "description": "ExpressionEngine before 5.3.2 allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code in a .php%20 file via Compose Msg, Add attachment, and Save As Draft actions. A user with low privileges (member) is able to upload this. It is possible to bypass the MIME type check and file-extension check while uploading new files.

To exploit this, one must to be able to send and compose messages (at least).",
