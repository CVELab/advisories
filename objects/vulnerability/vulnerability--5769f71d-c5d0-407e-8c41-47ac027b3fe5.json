The vulnerability is due to improper management of authenticated sessions in the WebVPN portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with valid credentials and accessing a specific URL in the WebVPN portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.",
