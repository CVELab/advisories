            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: use the workqueue to destroy unaccepted sockets\n\nChristoph reported a UaF at token lookup time after having\nrefactored the passive socket initialization part:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __token_bucket_busy+0x253/0x260\n  Read of size 4 at addr ffff88810698d5b0 by task syz-executor653/3198\n\n  CPU: 1 PID: 3198 Comm: syz-executor653 Not tainted 6.2.0-rc59af4eaa31c1f6c00c8f1e448ed99a45c66340dd5 #6\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x6e/0x91\n   print_report+0x16a/0x46f\n   kasan_report+0xad/0x130\n   __token_bucket_busy+0x253/0x260\n   mptcp_token_new_connect+0x13d/0x490\n   mptcp_connect+0x4ed/0x860\n   __inet_stream_connect+0x80e/0xd90\n   tcp_sendmsg_fastopen+0x3ce/0x710\n   mptcp_sendmsg+0xff1/0x1a20\n   inet_sendmsg+0x11d/0x140\n   __sys_sendto+0x405/0x490\n   __x64_sys_sendto+0xdc/0x1b0\n   do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x72/0xdc\n\nWe need to properly clean-up all the paired MPTCP-level\nresources and be sure to release the msk last, even when\nthe unaccepted subflow is destroyed by the TCP internals\nvia inet_child_forget().\n\nWe can re-use the existing MPTCP_WORK_CLOSE_SUBFLOW infra,\nexplicitly checking that for the critical scenario: the\nclosed subflow is the MPC one, the msk is not accepted and\neventually going through full cleanup.\n\nWith such change, __mptcp_destroy_sock() is always called\non msk sockets, even on accepted ones. We don't need anymore\nto transiently drop one sk reference at msk clone time.\n\nPlease note this commit depends on the parent one:\n\n  mptcp: refactor passive socket initialization",
