            "description": "The Disable Auto Updates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'disable-auto-updates' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disable all auto updates via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
