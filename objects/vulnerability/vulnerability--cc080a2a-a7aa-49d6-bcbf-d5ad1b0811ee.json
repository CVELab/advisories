            "description": "An issue was discovered in Devid Espenschied PC Analyser through 4.10. The PCADRVX64.SYS kernel driver exposes IOCTL functionality that allows low-privilege users to read and write to arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs). This could lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
