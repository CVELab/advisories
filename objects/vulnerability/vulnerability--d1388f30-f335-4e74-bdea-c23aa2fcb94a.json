The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system and injecting malicious arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg38807.",
