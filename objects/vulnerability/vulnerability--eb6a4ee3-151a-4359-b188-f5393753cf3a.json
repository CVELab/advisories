This vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the registration API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to register a rogue Cisco UCSM and gain access to Cisco UCS Central Software data and Cisco UCSM inventory data.",
