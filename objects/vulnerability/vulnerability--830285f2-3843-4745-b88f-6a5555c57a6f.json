            "description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated but unprivileged (level 1), remote attacker to run privileged Cisco IOS commands by using the web UI. The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate and sanitize input in Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious payload to the affected device's web UI. A successful exploit could allow the lower-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary commands with higher privileges on the affected device.",
