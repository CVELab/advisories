            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber Client Framework (JCF) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input of an affected client. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary JavaScript in the Jabber client of the recipient. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the targeted client or allow the attacker to access sensitive client-based information.",
