            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the video service of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted traffic to the video service of an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the video service to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.",
