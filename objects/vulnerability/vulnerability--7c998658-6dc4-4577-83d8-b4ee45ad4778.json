            "description": "DataSpider Servista version 4.4 and earlier uses a hard-coded cryptographic key. DataSpider Servista is data integration software. ScriptRunner and ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS are used to start the configured processes on DataSpider Servista. The cryptographic key is embedded in ScriptRunner and ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS, which is common to all users. If an attacker who can gain access to a target DataSpider Servista instance and obtain a Launch Settings file of ScriptRunner and/or ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS, the attacker may perform operations with the user privilege encrypted in the file.",
