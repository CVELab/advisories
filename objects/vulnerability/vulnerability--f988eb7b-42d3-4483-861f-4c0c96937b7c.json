            "description": "The EWWW Image Optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ewww_ngg_bulk_init() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk image optimization via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
