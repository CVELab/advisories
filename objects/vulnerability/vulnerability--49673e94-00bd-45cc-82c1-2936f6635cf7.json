            "description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in runtime environments, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. It was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. ",
