            "description": "An Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere vulnerability in the sampling service of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send arbitrary data to the device, which leads msvcsd process to crash with limited availability impacting Denial of Service (DoS) and allows unauthorized network access to the device, potentially impacting system integrity.\n\nThis issue only happens when inline jflow is configured.\n\nThis does not impact any forwarding traffic. The impacted services MSVCS-DB app crashes momentarily and recovers by itself. \n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: \n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S7-EVO; \n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3-EVO;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S2-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.",
