            "description": "A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet handling function of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to information stored in MPLS buffer memory. This vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed MPLS packets that are processed by a device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted MPLS packet to an affected device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software or Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
