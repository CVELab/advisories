            "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Jabber could allow an authenticated, local attacker to retrieve user profile information from the affected software, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checks in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating locally to an affected system and then issuing specific commands to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view all profile information for a user instead of only certain Jabber parameters that should be visible. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco Jabber prior to Release 1.9.31. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve52418.",
