            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak\n\nBelow is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during\ntransmit:\n    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;\n    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;\n    consumer_index ++;\nWhere variable data looks like this:\n    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]\n                                               \tconsumer_index^\n    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]\n\nThe driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to\na valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed\nto an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and\ntx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an\nskb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop\nsending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.\n\nTherefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If\nnot then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be\npatched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.",
