[kcompactd0:479]\n  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 52s! [kcompactd0:479]\n  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 78s! [kcompactd0:479]\n  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 104s! [kcompactd0:479]\n\nThe machine had 256G of RAM with no swap and an earlier failed\nallocation indicated that node 0 where kcompactd was run was potentially\nunreclaimable;\n\n  Node 0 active_anon:29355112kB inactive_anon:2913528kB active_file:0kB\n    inactive_file:0kB unevictable:64kB isolated(anon):0kB isolated(file):0kB\n    mapped:8kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB shmem:26780kB shmem_thp:\n    0kB shmem_pmdmapped: 0kB anon_thp: 23480320kB writeback_tmp:0kB\n    kernel_stack:2272kB pagetables:24500kB all_unreclaimable? yes\n\nVlastimil Babka investigated a crash dump and found that a task\nmigrating pages was trying to drain PCP lists;\n\n  PID: 52922  TASK: ffff969f820e5000  CPU: 19  COMMAND: \"kworker/u128:3\"\n  Call Trace:\n     __schedule\n     schedule\n     schedule_timeout\n     wait_for_completion\n     __flush_work\n     __drain_all_pages\n     __alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.114\n     __alloc_pages\n     alloc_migration_target\n     migrate_pages\n     migrate_to_node\n     do_migrate_pages\n     cpuset_migrate_mm_workfn\n     process_one_work\n     worker_thread\n     kthread\n     ret_from_fork\n\nThis failure is specific to CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds.  The root of the\nproblem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task that\nhas isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting on\nkcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  While\nshrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaim\ncan continue without rescheduling if sc->skipped_deactivate == 1 which\ncould happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was not\nlow.",
