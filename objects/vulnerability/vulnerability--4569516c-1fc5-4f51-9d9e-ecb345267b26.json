Though\nthis overflow condition is not observed but it is a potential problem\nin the case of 32-bit multiplication. Hence fix it by changing the\ndesc_size data type to size_t.\n\nIn addition to coverity fix it also reuse ZYNQMP_DMA_DESC_SIZE macro in\ndma_alloc_coherent API argument.\n\nAddresses-Coverity: Event overflow_before_widen.",
