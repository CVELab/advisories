            "description": "CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA update.cgi Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA devices. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of update packages provided to update.cgi. The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-24355.",
