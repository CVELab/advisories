            "description": "A Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIn a scenario where DHCP relay or local server is configured the problem can be triggered if a DHCPv4 packet with specific options is received leading to a corruption of the options read from the packet. This corruption can then lead to jdhcpd crash and restart.\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n17.4R1 and later versions prior to 18.4R3-S10;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S4;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S2;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S2, 21.2R2, 21.2R3;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R1-S1, 21.3R2.",
