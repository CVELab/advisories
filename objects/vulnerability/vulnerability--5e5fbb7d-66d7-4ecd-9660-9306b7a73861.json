            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/mlx5: Fix releasing unallocated memory in dereg MR flow\n\nFor the case of IB_MR_TYPE_DM the mr does doesn't have a umem, even though\nit is a user MR. This causes function mlx5_free_priv_descs() to think that\nit is a kernel MR, leading to wrongly accessing mr->descs that will get\nwrong values in the union which leads to attempt to release resources that\nwere not allocated in the first place.\n\nFor example:\n DMA-API: mlx5_core 0000:08:00.1: device driver tries to free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x0000000000000000] [size=0 bytes]\n WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 1021 at kernel/dma/debug.c:961 check_unmap+0x54f/0x8b0\n RIP: 0010:check_unmap+0x54f/0x8b0\n Call Trace:\n  debug_dma_unmap_page+0x57/0x60\n  mlx5_free_priv_descs+0x57/0x70 [mlx5_ib]\n  mlx5_ib_dereg_mr+0x1fb/0x3d0 [mlx5_ib]\n  ib_dereg_mr_user+0x60/0x140 [ib_core]\n  uverbs_destroy_uobject+0x59/0x210 [ib_uverbs]\n  uobj_destroy+0x3f/0x80 [ib_uverbs]\n  ib_uverbs_cmd_verbs+0x435/0xd10 [ib_uverbs]\n  ? uverbs_finalize_object+0x50/0x50 [ib_uverbs]\n  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0\n  ? lock_acquired+0x12/0x380\n  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0\n  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0\n  ? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0x7c/0x140 [ib_uverbs]\n  ? lock_release+0x28a/0x400\n  ib_uverbs_ioctl+0xc0/0x140 [ib_uverbs]\n  ? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0x7c/0x140 [ib_uverbs]\n  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x7f/0xb0\n  do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90\n\nFix it by reorganizing the dereg flow and mlx5_ib_mr structure:\n - Move the ib_umem field into the user MRs structure in the union as it's\n   applicable only there.\n - Function mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() will now call mlx5_free_priv_descs() only\n   in case there isn't udata, which indicates that this isn't a user MR.",
