            "description": "A vulnerability in the xAPI service of Cisco Telepresence CE Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to generate an access token for an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the xAPI service to generate a specific token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use the generated token to enable experimental features on the device that should not be available to users.",
