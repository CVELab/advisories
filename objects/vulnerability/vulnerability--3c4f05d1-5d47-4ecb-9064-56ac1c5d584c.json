This vulnerability is due to incorrect feed update processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that should be blocked by the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass device controls and successfully send traffic to devices that are expected to be protected by the affected device.",
