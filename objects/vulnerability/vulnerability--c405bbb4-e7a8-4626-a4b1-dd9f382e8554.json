            "description": "Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM1004 Partnumber 1098148 with firmware version < 2.0.0 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to a increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 2.0.0 as soon as possible.",
