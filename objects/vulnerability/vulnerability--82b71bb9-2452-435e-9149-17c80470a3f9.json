SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V4.5.0), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions), SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced (All versions < V4.0). Affected devices are vulnerable to a memory protection bypass through a specific operation. A remote unauthenticated attacker with network access to port 102/tcp could potentially write arbitrary data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks.",
