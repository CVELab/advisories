            "description": "hoolock is a suite of lightweight utilities designed to maintain a small footprint when bundled. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.2.1, utility functions related to object paths (`get`, `set`, and `update`) did not block attempts to access or alter object prototypes. Starting in version 2.2.1, the `get`, `set` and `update` functions throw a `TypeError` when a user attempts to access or alter inherited properties.",
