            "description": "Debian tmpreaper version 1.6.13+nmu1 has a race condition when doing a (bind) mount via rename() which could result in local privilege escalation. Mounting via rename() could potentially lead to a file being placed elsewhereon the filesystem hierarchy (e.g. /etc/cron.d/) if the directory being cleaned up was on the same physical filesystem. Fixed versions include 1.6.13+nmu1+deb9u1 and 1.6.14.",
