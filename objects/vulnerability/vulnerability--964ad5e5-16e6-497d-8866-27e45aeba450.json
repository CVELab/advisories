The vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific command at the command line. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read-only access to files that are located on the flash: filesystem that otherwise might not have been accessible.",
