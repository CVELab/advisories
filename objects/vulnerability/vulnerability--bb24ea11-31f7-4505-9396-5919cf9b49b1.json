            "description": "This repository hosts source code implementing the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) TPM2 Software Stack (TSS). The JSON Quote Info returned by Fapi_Quote has to be deserialized by Fapi_VerifyQuote to the TPM Structure `TPMS_ATTEST`. For the field `TPM2_GENERATED magic` of this structure any number can be used in the JSON structure. The verifier can receive a state which does not represent the actual, possibly malicious state of the device under test. The malicious device might get access to data it shouldn't, or can use services it shouldn't be able to. This \nissue has been patched in version 4.1.0.",
