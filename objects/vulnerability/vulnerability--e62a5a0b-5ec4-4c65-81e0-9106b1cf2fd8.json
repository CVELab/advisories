            "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to an API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application.",
