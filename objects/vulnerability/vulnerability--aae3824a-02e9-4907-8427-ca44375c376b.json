            "description": "An untrusted search path remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Trend Micro Secuity 2020 (v16.0.0.1146 and below) consumer family of products could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. As the Trend Micro installer tries to load DLL files from its current directory, an arbitrary DLL could also be loaded with the same privileges as the installer if run as Administrator. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerbaility in that the target must open a malicious directory or device.",
