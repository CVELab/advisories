            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\num: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode\n\nsched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in\ntime-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to\nbe a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with\ntime-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on\nthe kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).\n\nWork around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a\nsched_yield syscall.",
