            "description": "A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.",
