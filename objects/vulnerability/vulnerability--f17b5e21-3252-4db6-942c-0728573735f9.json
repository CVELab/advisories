            "description": "In CloudVision Portal (CVP) for all releases in the 2018.2 Train, under certain conditions, the application logs user passwords in plain text for certain API calls, potentially leading to user password exposure. This only affects CVP environments where: 1. Devices have enable mode passwords which are different from the user's login password, OR 2. There are configlet builders that use the Device class and specify username and password explicitly Application logs are not accessible or visible from the CVP GUI. Application logs can only be read by authorized users with privileged access to the VM hosting the CVP application.",
