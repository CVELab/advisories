            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nCDC-NCM: avoid overflow in sanity checking\n\nA broken device may give an extreme offset like 0xFFF0\nand a reasonable length for a fragment. In the sanity\ncheck as formulated now, this will create an integer\noverflow, defeating the sanity check. Both offset\nand offset + len need to be checked in such a manner\nthat no overflow can occur.\nAnd those quantities should be unsigned.",
