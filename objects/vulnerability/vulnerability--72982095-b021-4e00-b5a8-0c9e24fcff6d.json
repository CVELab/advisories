            "description": "motionEye is an online interface for the software motion, a video surveillance program with motion detection. In versions 0.43.1b1 through 0.43.1b3, using a constructed (camera) device path with the `add`/`add_camera` motionEye web API allows an attacker with motionEye admin user credentials to execute any command within a non-interactive shell as motionEye run user, `motion` by default. The vulnerability has been patched with motionEye v0.43.1b4. As a workaround, apply the patch manually.",
