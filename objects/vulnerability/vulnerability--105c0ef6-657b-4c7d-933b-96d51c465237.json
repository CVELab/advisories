            "description": "Logsign Unified SecOps Platform Missing Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the cluster HTTP API, which listens on TCP port 1924 when enabled. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-24169.",
