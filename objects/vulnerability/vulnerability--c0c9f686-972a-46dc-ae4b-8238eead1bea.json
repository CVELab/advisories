            "description": "A vulnerability was found in D-Link DI-8100 up to 16.07.26A1 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /ddos.asp of the component jhttpd. The manipulation of the argument def_max/def_time/def_tcp_max/def_tcp_time/def_udp_max/def_udp_time/def_icmp_max leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult.",
