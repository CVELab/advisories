            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco&nbsp;Integrated Management Controller could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to enumerate valid usernames within the vulnerable application.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to differences in authentication responses sent back from the application as part of an authentication attempt. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending authentication requests to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to confirm the names of administrative user accounts for use in further attacks.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
