            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux operating system (OS) without the proper authentication. The attacker would need valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input for certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and submitting crafted input for a CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to the underlying Linux OS without proper authentication.",
