            "description": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP and picoTCP-NG through 1.7.0. The TCP input data processing function in pico_tcp.c does not validate the length of incoming TCP packets, which leads to an out-of-bounds read when assembling received packets into a data segment, eventually causing Denial-of-Service or an information leak.",
