            "description": "A vulnerability in the NX API (NX-API) Sandbox interface for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the NX-API Sandbox interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the NX-API Sandbox interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the NX-API Sandbox interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected NX-API Sandbox interface.",
