The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the exif processing module for a PNG file (during XPS conversion). Invalid input leads to a computation where pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.",
