            "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `ThreadUnsafeUnigramCandidateSampler` is given input `filterbank_channel_count` greater than the allowed max size, TensorFlow will crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 39ec7eaf1428e90c37787e5b3fbd68ebd3c48860. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
