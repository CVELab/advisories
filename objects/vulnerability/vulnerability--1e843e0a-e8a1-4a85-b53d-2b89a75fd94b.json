            "description": "The Widgets for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 10.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation within setup_no_reg_header.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset plugin settings and remove reviews via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
