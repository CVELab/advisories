The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the device, possibly resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.",
