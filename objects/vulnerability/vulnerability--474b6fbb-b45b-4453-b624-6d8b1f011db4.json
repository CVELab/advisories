The timer is setup in\nprobe and there is no timer_delete operation in remove\nfunction. When it hit kfree btv, the function might still be\ninvoked, which will cause use after free bug.\n\nThis bug is found by static analysis, it may be false positive.\n\nFix it by adding del_timer_sync invoking to the remove function.\n\ncpu0                cpu1\n                  bttv_probe\n                    ->timer_setup\n                      ->bttv_set_dma\n                        ->mod_timer;\nbttv_remove\n  ->kfree(btv);\n                  ->bttv_irq_timeout\n                    ->USE btv",
