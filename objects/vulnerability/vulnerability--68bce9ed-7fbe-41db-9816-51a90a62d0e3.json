Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) can occur under the /api/v1/getbodyfile endpoint via the uri parameter. The web application (through its vShare functionality section) doesn't properly check parameters, sent in HTTP requests as input, before saving them on the server. In addition, crafted JavaScript content can then be reflected back to the end user and executed by the web browser.",
