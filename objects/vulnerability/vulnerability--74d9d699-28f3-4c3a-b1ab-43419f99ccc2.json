            "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker from the same shared physical or logical network, to cause a heap memory leak and leading to FPC crash. On all Junos PTX Series and QFX10000 Series, when specific EVPN VXLAN Multicast packets are processed, an FPC heap memory leak is observed. The FPC memory usage can be monitored using the CLI command \"show heap extensive\". Following is an example output.
