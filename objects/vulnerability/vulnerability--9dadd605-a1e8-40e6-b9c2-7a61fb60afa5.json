            "description": "The External Visitor Manager portal of HIDâ€™s SAFE versions 5.8.0 through\n 5.11.3 are vulnerable to manipulation within web fields in the \napplication programmable interface (API). An attacker could log in using\n account credentials available through a request generated by an \ninternal user and then manipulate the visitor-id within the web API to \naccess the personal data of other users. There is no limit on the number\n of requests that can be made to the HID SAFE Web Server, so an attacker\n could also exploit this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service \ncondition.\n\n",
