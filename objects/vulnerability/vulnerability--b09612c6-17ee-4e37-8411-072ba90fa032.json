            "description": "Garuda Linux performs an insecure user creation and authentication that allows any user to impersonate the created account. By creating users from the 'Garuda settings manager', an insecure procedure is performed that keeps the created user without an assigned password during some seconds. This could allow a potential attacker to exploit this vulnerability in order to authenticate without knowing the password.",
