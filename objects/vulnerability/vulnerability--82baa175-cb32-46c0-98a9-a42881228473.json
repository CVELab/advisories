            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs\n\nThe commit b8c43360f6e4 (\"net: stmmac: No need to calculate speed divider\nwhen offload is disabled\") allows the \"port_transmit_rate_kbps\" to be\nset to a value of 0, which is then passed to the \"div_s64\" function when\ntc-cbs is disabled. This leads to a zero-division error.\n\nWhen tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and credit values the\ncredit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a return\nstatement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled would\nprevent a zero-division error.",
