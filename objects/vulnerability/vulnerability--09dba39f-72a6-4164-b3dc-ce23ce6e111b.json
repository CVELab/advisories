            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()\n\nAfter device is initialized via device_initialize(), or its name is set via\ndev_set_name(), the device has to be freed via put_device().  Otherwise\ndevice name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in\ndev_set_name().\n\nFix the leak by replacing kfree() with put_device(). Since\nscsi_host_dev_release() properly handles IDA and kthread removal, remove\nspecial-casing these from the error handling as well.",
