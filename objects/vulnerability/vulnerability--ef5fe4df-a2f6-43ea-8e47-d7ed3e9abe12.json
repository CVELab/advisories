            "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the format_channel_mask function in gst-discoverer.c. The vulnerability affects the local array position, which is defined with a fixed size of 64 elements. However, the function gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels may return a guint channels value greater than 64. This causes the for loop to attempt access beyond the bounds of the position array, resulting in an OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used. This vulnerability can result in reading unintended bytes from the stack. Additionally, the dereference of value->value_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
