            "description": "net-snmp provides various tools relating to the Simple Network Management Protocol. Prior to version 5.9.2, a malformed OID in a SET request to `SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmAccessTable` can cause an out-of-bounds memory access. A user with read-write credentials can exploit the issue. Version 5.9.2 contains a patch. Users should use strong SNMPv3 credentials and avoid sharing the credentials. Those who must use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c should use a complex community string and enhance the protection by restricting access to a given IP address range.\n",
