            "description": "In NetX HTTP server functionality of Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo before \nversion 6.4.3, an attacker can cause an integer underflow and a \nsubsequent denial of service by writing a very large file, by specially \ncrafted packets with Content-Length in one packet smaller than the data \nrequest size of the other packet. A possible workaround is to disable \nHTTP PUT support.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue follows an incomplete fix of CVE-2025-0727",
