            "description": "The kdump implementation is missing the host key verification in the kdump and mkdumprd OpenSSH integration of kdump prior to version 2012-01-20. This is similar to CVE-2011-3588, but different in that the kdump implementation is specific to SUSE. A remote malicious kdump server could use this flaw to impersonate the correct kdump server to obtain security sensitive information (kdump core files).",
