            "description": "QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It occurs while doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains null, which leads to the null pointer dereference. A user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in DoS issue.",
