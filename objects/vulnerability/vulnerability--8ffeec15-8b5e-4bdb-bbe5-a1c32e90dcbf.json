            "description": "A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows a local user on a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory. An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.",
