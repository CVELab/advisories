Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of CGI scripts. When parsing the getpage parameter, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-10932.",
