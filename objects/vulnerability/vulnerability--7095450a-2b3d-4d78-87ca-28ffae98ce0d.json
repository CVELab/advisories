            "description": "1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. Prior to  v1.10.3-lts, there are many command injections in the project, and some of them are not well filtered, leading to arbitrary file writes, and ultimately leading to RCEs. The mirror configuration write symbol `>` can be used to achieve arbitrary file writing. This vulnerability is fixed in  v1.10.3-lts.",
