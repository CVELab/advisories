In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for the SetProcessAttributes administrative function. Abusing this function will allow any Blue Prism user to publish, unpublish, or retire processes. Using this function, any logged-in user can change the status of a process, an action allowed only intended for users with the Edit Process permission.",
