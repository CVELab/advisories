            "description": "There are stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Aruba Networks access point management protocol) UDP port (8211). Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities result in the ability to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.",
