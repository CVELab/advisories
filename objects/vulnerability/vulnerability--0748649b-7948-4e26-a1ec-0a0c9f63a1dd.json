            "description": "The Delete Usermeta plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the delumet_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove user meta for arbitrary users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
