SSRF vulnerabilities allow the attacker to exploit the target system to make network requests on their behalf, allowing a range of possible attacks. In the most common scenario, the attacker exploits SSRF vulnerabilities to attack systems behind the firewall and access sensitive information from Cloud Provider metadata services.",
