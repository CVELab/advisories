The Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.",
