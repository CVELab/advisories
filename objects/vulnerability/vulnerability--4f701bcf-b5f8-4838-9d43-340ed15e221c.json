            "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat-Desktop <3.8.14 that could allow an attacker to pass a malicious url of openInternalVideoChatWindow to shell.openExternal(), which may lead to remote code execution (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L17). To exploit the vulnerability, the internal video chat window must be disabled or a Mac App Store build must be used (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L14). The vulnerability may be exploited by an XSS attack because the function openInternalVideoChatWindow is exposed in the Rocket.Chat-Desktop-API.",
