            "description": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted update file to the device that can overflow a buffer. This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. The overflowed data can allow the attacker to manipulate the “normal” code execution to that of their choosing. An attacker with this level of access on the device can monitor all communications sent to and from this device, modify onboard relays, change configuration files, or cause the device to become unstable.",
