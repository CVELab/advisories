            "description": "** DISPUTED ** Race condition in Sophos Endpoint Security and Control 9.0.5 on Windows XP allows local users to bypass kernel-mode hook handlers, and execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked by a handler but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain user-space memory changes during hook-handler execution, aka an argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is a flaw in a protection mechanism for situations where a crafted program has already begun to execute.",
