This memory leak, over time, will lead to an rpd crash and restart.\n\nThe memory usage can be monitored using the below command.\n\nuser@host> show task memory detail | match patroot\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S3;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S3;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3.\n\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-EVO;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-EVO;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
