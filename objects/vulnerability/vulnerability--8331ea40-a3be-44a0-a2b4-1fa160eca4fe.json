This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as subscribers, to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying knowledge bases, modifying notices, modifying payments, managing vendors, capabilities, and so much more. There were hundreds of AJAX endpoints affected.",
