            "description": "A flaw was found in gnome-remote-desktop. Once gnome-remote-desktop listens for RDP connections, an unauthenticated attacker can exhaust system resources and repeatedly crash the process. There may be a resource leak after many attacks, which will also result in gnome-remote-desktop no longer being able to open files even after it is restarted via systemd.",
