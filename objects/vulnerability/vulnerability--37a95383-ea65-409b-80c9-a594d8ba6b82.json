            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix use-after-free on inode when scanning root during em shrinking\n\nAt btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the inode's root (and fs_info) in a\ncall to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode for a delayed\niput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the\ncleaner kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call\nto btrfs_fs_closing().\n\nFix this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead\nof doing inode->root->fs_info.",
