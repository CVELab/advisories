            "description": "An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string issue. (This is not exploitable when glibc has CVE-2016-10739 fixed.). This is fixed in: v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1; v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12; v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9; v3.8.3, v3.8.3rc1, v3.8.4, v3.8.4rc1, v3.8.5, v3.8.6, v3.8.6rc1.",
