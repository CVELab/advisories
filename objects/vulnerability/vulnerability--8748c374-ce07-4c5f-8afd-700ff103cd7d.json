            "description": "** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in MyBloggie 2.1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mybloggie_root_path parameter to (1) admin.php or (2) scode.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed in multiple third party followups, which say that the MyBloggie source code does not demonstrate the issue, so it might be the result of another module.  CVE analysis as of 20060605 agrees with the dispute.  In addition, scode.php is not part of the MyBloggie distribution.",
