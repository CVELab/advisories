            "description": "Due to missing authorization check, SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP - versions 700, 701, 702, 731, allows an authenticated attacker, to access content on the start screen of any transaction that is available with in the same SAP system even if he/she isn't authorized for that transaction. A successful exploitation could expose information and in worst case manipulate data before the start screen is executed, resulting in limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.",
