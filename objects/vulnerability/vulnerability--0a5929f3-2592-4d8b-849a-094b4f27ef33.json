            "description": "TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables, TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.",
