            "description": "A packet processing mechanism in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables a remote attacker to reboot hardware-based firewalls. Repeated attacks eventually cause the firewall to enter maintenance mode, which requires manual intervention to bring the firewall back online.\n\nThis affects the following hardware firewall models:\n- PA-5400 Series firewalls\n- PA-7000 Series firewalls",
