            "description": "\nAn Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause memory leak, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS QFX5000 Series platforms, when pseudo-VTEP (Virtual Tunnel End Point) is configured under EVPN-VXLAN scenario, and specific DHCP packets are transmitted, DMA memory leak is observed. Continuous receipt of these specific DHCP packets will cause memory leak to reach 99% and then cause the protocols to stop working and traffic is impacted, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) condition. A manual reboot of the system recovers from the memory leak.\n\nTo confirm the memory leak, monitor for \"sheaf:possible leak\" and \"vtep not found\" messages in the logs.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS QFX5000 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S6;\n  *  21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-S2, 22.2R3;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
