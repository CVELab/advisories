            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup\n\nIf iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing\ndown already-configured groups and default domains, however this\ncurrently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even\nhistorically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across\narchitectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present\nwhose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to\nwork anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put\nthings back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly\nthe potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure\nwe clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.",
