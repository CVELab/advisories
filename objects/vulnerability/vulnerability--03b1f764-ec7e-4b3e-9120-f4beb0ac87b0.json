            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task\n\nCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper\nlayer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or\nmpi_sata_completion().\n\nIn this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/O\ncompletions:\n\n - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of\n   the I/O.\n\n - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in\n   pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.\n\nWhen complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,\nwe should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the\npm8001_ccb_task_free() call.\n\nFix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.",
