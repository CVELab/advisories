            "description": "The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_theme() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary themes from the website via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. In versions prior to 1.8.6 it was possible to download the entire sites files.",
