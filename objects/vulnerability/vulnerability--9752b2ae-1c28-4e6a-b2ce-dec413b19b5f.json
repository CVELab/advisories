            "description": "The ventilator does not perform proper file integrity checks when adopting firmware updates. This makes it possible for an attacker to force unauthorized changes to the device's configuration settings and/or compromise device functionality by pushing a compromised/illegitimate firmware file. This could disrupt the function of the device and/or cause unauthorized information disclosure.",
