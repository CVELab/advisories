            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: ignore negated quota changes\n\nWhen lots of quota changes are made, there may be cases in which an\ninode's quota information is increased and then decreased, such as when\nblocks are added to a file, then deleted from it. If the timing is\nright, function do_qc can add pending quota changes to a transaction,\nthen later, another call to do_qc can negate those changes, resulting\nin a net gain of 0. The quota_change information is recorded in the qc\nbuffer (and qd element of the inode as well). The buffer is added to the\ntransaction by the first call to do_qc, but a subsequent call changes\nthe value from non-zero back to zero. At that point it's too late to\nremove the buffer_head from the transaction. Later, when the quota sync\ncode is called, the zero-change qd element is discovered and flagged as\nan assert warning. If the fs is mounted with errors=panic, the kernel\nwill panic.\n\nThis is usually seen when files are truncated and the quota changes are\nnegated by punch_hole/truncate which uses gfs2_quota_hold and\ngfs2_quota_unhold rather than block allocations that use gfs2_quota_lock\nand gfs2_quota_unlock which automatically do quota sync.\n\nThis patch solves the problem by adding a check to qd_check_sync such\nthat net-zero quota changes already added to the transaction are no\nlonger deemed necessary to be synced, and skipped.\n\nIn this case references are taken for the qd and the slot from do_qc\nso those need to be put. The normal sequence of events for a normal\nnon-zero quota change is as follows:\n\ngfs2_quota_change\n   do_qc\n      qd_hold\n      slot_hold\n\nLater, when the changes are to be synced:\n\ngfs2_quota_sync\n   qd_fish\n      qd_check_sync\n         gets qd ref via lockref_get_not_dead\n   do_sync\n      do_qc(QC_SYNC)\n         qd_put\n\t    lockref_put_or_lock\n   qd_unlock\n      qd_put\n         lockref_put_or_lock\n\nIn the net-zero change case, we add a check to qd_check_sync so it puts\nthe qd and slot references acquired in gfs2_quota_change and skip the\nunneeded sync.",
