            "description": "RARLAB WinRAR Mark-Of-The-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-Of-The-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of RARLAB WinRAR. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must perform a specific action on a malicious page.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the archive extraction functionality. A crafted archive entry can cause the creation of an arbitrary file without the Mark-Of-The-Web. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23156.",
