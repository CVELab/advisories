            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()\n\nIn nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(), brelse(bh) is called to drop the\nreference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If\nthe reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked, bh may be\nfreed.  However, bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that,\nwhich may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release\noperation after unlocking and putting the page.\n\nNOTE: The function in question is only called in GC, and in combination\nwith current userland tools, address translation using DAT does not occur\nin that function, so the code path that causes this issue will not be\nexecuted.  However, it is possible to run that code path by intentionally\nmodifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.\n\n[konishi.ryusuke@gmail.com: NOTE added to the commit log]",
