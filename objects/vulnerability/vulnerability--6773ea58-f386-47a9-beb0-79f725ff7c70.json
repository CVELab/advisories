This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as subscribers, to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying shipping method details, modifying products, deleting arbitrary posts, and privilege escalation (via the wp_ajax_wcfm_vendor_store_online AJAX action).",
