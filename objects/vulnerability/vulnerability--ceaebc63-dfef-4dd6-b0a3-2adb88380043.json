            "description": "The Events Manager â€“ Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'event', 'location', and 'event_category' shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
