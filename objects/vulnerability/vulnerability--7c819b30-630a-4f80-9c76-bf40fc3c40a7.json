            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Secure Email Gateway, and Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
