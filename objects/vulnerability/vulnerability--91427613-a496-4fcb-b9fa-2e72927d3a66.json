            "description": "A vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.",
