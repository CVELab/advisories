            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Player for Windows and MacOS could allow an attacker to cause the affected software to terminate or to gain access to memory state information that is related to the vulnerable application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of values in Webex recording files that are stored in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious WRF file to a user as a link or email attachment and then persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the affected software and view memory state information.",
