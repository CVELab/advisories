            "description": "A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco&nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the October 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.
