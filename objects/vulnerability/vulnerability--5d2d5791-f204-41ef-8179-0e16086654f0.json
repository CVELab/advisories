User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of TIScript. When processing the launch method the application does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-7250.",
