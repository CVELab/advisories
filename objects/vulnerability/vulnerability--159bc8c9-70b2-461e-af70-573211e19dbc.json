            "description": "Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability whereby an attacker canÂ directly communicate with the driver by accessing the \\\"\\\\\\\\.\\\\pmem\\\" device. From that point, it is possible to communicate with the driver via regular device operations, starting with a system of IOCTLs. To send specific orders to the driver, one can use IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL control code. This issue is remediated in version 4.1.",
