Starting in version 25.0.0 and prior to versions 25.0.13, 26.0.8, and 27.1.3 of Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server, when a user is tricked into copy pasting HTML code without markup (Ctrl+Shift+V) the markup will actually render. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 25.0.13, 26.0.8, and 27.1.3 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, disable app text.",
