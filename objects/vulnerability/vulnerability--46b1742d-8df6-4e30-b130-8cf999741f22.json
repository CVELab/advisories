            "description": "An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the KCodes NetUSB.ko kernel module which enables the ReadySHARE Printer functionality of at least two NETGEAR Nighthawk Routers and potentially several other vendors/products. A specially crafted index value can cause an invalid memory read, resulting in a denial of service or remote information disclosure. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted packet on the local network to trigger this vulnerability.",
