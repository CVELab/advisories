            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_midi: fix MIDI Streaming descriptor lengths\n\nWhile the MIDI jacks are configured correctly, and the MIDIStreaming\nendpoint descriptors are filled with the correct information,\nbNumEmbMIDIJack and bLength are set incorrectly in these descriptors.\n\nThis does not matter when the numbers of in and out ports are equal, but\nwhen they differ the host will receive broken descriptors with\nuninitialized stack memory leaking into the descriptor for whichever\nvalue is smaller.\n\nThe precise meaning of \"in\" and \"out\" in the port counts is not clearly\ndefined and can be confusing.  But elsewhere the driver consistently\nuses this to match the USB meaning of IN and OUT viewed from the host,\nso that \"in\" ports send data to the host and \"out\" ports receive data\nfrom it.",
