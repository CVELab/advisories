Versions prior to 3.0.1 (stable), 3.1.0.beta2 (beta), and 3.1.0.beta2 (tests-passed) are subject to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. As there is no limit on data contained in a draft, a malicious user can create an arbitrarily large draft, forcing the instance to a crawl. This issue is patched in versions 3.0.1 (stable), 3.1.0.beta2 (beta), and 3.1.0.beta2 (tests-passed). There are no workarounds.",
