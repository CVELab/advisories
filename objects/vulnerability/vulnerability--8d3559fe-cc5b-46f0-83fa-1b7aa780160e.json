            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING\n\nXiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with\nsmall possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commit\nbed9e27baf52 (\"Revert \"md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d\"\")\n\nHowever, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated\nthe problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue\nfrom raid5d().\n\nCurrent implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:\n\n1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear\n   MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING;\n2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;\n3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;\n\nThis behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if other\ncontext hold 'reconfig_mutex', and md_check_recovery() can't update\nsuper_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until\n'reconfig_mutex' is released.\n\nRefer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by\nskipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after\nmd_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex'\nis released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well.",
