            "description": "Certain communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services inadvertently use TLS 1.0, which is known to be a cryptographically weak protocol. These cloud services include Cortex Data Lake, the Customer Support Portal, and the Prisma Access infrastructure. Conditions required for exploitation of known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services. We do not believe that any communication is impacted as a result of known attacks against TLS 1.0. This issue impacts: All versions of PAN-OS 8.0; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.14; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3. PAN-OS 7.1 is not impacted by this issue.",
