            "description": "Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by a \\n injection in the web UI's password field, which - due to several faulty aspects of the authentication scheme - allows the attacker to create (or overwrite) a file with specific content (e.g., the \"2\" string). This leads to admin session crafting and therefore gaining full web UI admin privileges by an unauthenticated attacker. This affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2, GC108PP before 1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS308T before 1.0.3.2, GS310TP before 1.0.3.2, GS710TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS716TP before 1.0.4.2, GS716TPP before 1.0.4.2, GS724TPP before 2.0.6.3, GS724TPv2 before 2.0.6.3, GS728TPPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS728TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS750E before 1.0.1.10, GS752TPP before 6.0.8.2, GS752TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, MS510TXM before 1.0.4.2, and MS510TXUP before 1.0.4.2.",
