            "description": "\nAn Improper Access Control vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access reports without authenticating, potentially containing sensitive configuration information.\n\nA feature was introduced in version 3.1.0 of the Paragon Active Assurance Control Center which allows users to selectively share account data. By exploiting this vulnerability, it is possible to access reports without being logged in, resulting in the opportunity for malicious exfiltration of user data.\n\nNote that the Paragon Active Assurance Control Center SaaS offering is not affected by this issue.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance versions 3.1.0, 3.2.0, 3.2.2, 3.3.0, 3.3.1, 3.4.0.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance versions earlier than 3.1.0.\n\n\n\n\n",
