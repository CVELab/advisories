            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials to bypass restrictions on the CLI. The vulnerability is due to insufficient security mechanisms in the restricted shell implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute a set of normally unauthorized commands with the privileges of a non-root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.",
