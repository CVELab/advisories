            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered\n\nThe power_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to be\nlong living in kernel references to power_supply devices.\n\nSpecifically unregistering a power_supply while some other code has\na reference to it triggers a WARN in power_supply_unregister():\n\n\tWARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));\n\nFolllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and the\nbacking data freed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect code\nwith a dangling reference, resulting in a crash the next time\ntusb1210_get_online() is called.\n\nFix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()\nfreeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leaves\na theoretical race window, but it avoids the issue when manually\nrmmod-ing the charger chip driver during development.",
