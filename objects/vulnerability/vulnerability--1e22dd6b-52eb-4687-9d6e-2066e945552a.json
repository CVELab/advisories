            "description": "A vulnerability in the secure boot implementation of Cisco Secure Firewalls 3100 Series that are running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to bypass the secure boot functionality. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific memory location during the boot process of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.",
