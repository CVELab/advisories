            "description": "The backend database of the Philips DoseWise Portal application versions 1.1.7.333 and 2.1.1.3069 uses hard-coded credentials for a database account with privileges that can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the database. For an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, elevated privileges are first required for an attacker to access the web application backend system files that contain the hard-coded credentials. Successful exploitation may allow a remote attacker to gain access to the database of the DWP application, which contains PHI.
