A XCMD can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of malicious commands to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability focuses on the unsafe use of the `WL_Key` and `WL_DefaultKeyID` configuration values in the function located at offset `0x1c7d28` of firmware 6.9Z , and even more specifically on the command execution occuring at offset `0x1c7f6c`.",
