            "description": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the processing of specially crafted LLDP frames by the Layer 2 Control Protocol Daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), or may lead to remote code execution (RCE). Continued receipt and processing of these frames, sent from the local broadcast domain, will repeatedly crash the l2cpd process and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S18; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2-S1, 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2.
