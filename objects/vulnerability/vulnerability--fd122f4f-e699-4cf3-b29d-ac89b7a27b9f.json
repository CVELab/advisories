            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev\n\nDuring successful probe, igc logs this:\n\n[    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHC added\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even before\nregister_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call works\non a partially uninitialized netdev.\n\nFix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right\nafter the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment,\njust as in igb.\n\nNow the log message is fine:\n\n[    5.200987] igc 0000:01:00.0 eth0: PHC added",
