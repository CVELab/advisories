            "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to validate if the value `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
