            "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.",
