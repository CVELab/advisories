            "description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor â€“ Best Elementor Templates, Widgets, Kits & WooCommerce Builders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting through editing context via the 'data-eael-wrapper-link' wrapper in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied protocols. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
