            "description": "The WooCommerce Etsy Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the etcpf_delete_feed() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete an export feed via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
