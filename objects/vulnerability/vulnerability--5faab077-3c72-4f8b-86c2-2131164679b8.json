Misuse of these credentials could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the software.\n\nThe HSQLDB is only included to facilitate installation, has been deprecated, and is not intended for production use per vendor guides. However, users who have not configured FileCatalyst Workflow to use an alternative database per recommendations are vulnerable to attack from any source that can reach the HSQLDB.",
