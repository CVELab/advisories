Apache Tapestry 4 will attempt to deserialize the \"sp\" parameter even before invoking the page's validate method, leading to deserialization without authentication. Apache Tapestry 4 reached end of life in 2008 and no update to address this issue will be released. Apache Tapestry 5 versions are not vulnerable to this issue. Users of Apache Tapestry 4 should upgrade to the latest Apache Tapestry 5 version.",
