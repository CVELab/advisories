            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: iaa - Fix potential use after free bug\n\nThe free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode) function frees\n\"device_mode\" but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few\nlines later resulting in a use after free.\n\nThe good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing implements the\n->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code.  But, with\nthis fix, when something does implement it, we'll be ready.  :)",
