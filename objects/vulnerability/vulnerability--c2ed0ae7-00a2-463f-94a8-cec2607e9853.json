            "description": "The ImageMapper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'imgmap_save_area_title' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the post title and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
