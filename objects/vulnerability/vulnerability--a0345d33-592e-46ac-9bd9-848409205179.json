            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Canon imageCLASS MF644Cdw 10.03 printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the BJNP service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16032.",
