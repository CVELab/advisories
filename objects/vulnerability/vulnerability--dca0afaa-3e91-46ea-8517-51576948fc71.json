            "description": "The FooGallery â€“ Responsive Photo Gallery, Image Viewer, Justified, Masonry & Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the default_gallery_title_size parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.29 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with granted gallery and album creator roles, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
