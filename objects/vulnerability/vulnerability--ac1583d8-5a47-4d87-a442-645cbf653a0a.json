            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nremoteproc: mediatek: Make sure IPI buffer fits in L2TCM\n\nThe IPI buffer location is read from the firmware that we load to the\nSystem Companion Processor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM\n(L2TCM) size that is defined in the devicetree node is large enough\nfor that, and while this is especially true for multi-core SCP, it's\nstill useful to check on single-core variants as well.\n\nFailing to perform this check may make this driver perform R/W\noperations out of the L2TCM boundary, resulting (at best) in a\nkernel panic.\n\nTo fix that, check that the IPI buffer fits, otherwise return a\nfailure and refuse to boot the relevant SCP core (or the SCP at\nall, if this is single core).",
