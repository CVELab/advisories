            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: don't skip expired elements during walk\n\nThere is an asymmetry between commit/abort and preparation phase if the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n\n1. set is a verdict map (\"1.2.3.4 : jump foo\")\n2. timeouts are enabled\n\nIn this case, following sequence is problematic:\n\n1. element E in set S refers to chain C\n2. userspace requests removal of set S\n3. kernel does a set walk to decrement chain->use count for all elements\n   from preparation phase\n4. kernel does another set walk to remove elements from the commit phase\n   (or another walk to do a chain->use increment for all elements from\n    abort phase)\n\nIf E has already expired in 1), it will be ignored during list walk, so its use count\nwon't have been changed.\n\nThen, when set is culled, ->destroy callback will zap the element via\nnf_tables_set_elem_destroy(), but this function is only safe for\nelements that have been deactivated earlier from the preparation phase:\nlack of earlier deactivate removes the element but leaks the chain use\ncount, which results in a WARN splat when the chain gets removed later,\nplus a leak of the nft_chain structure.\n\nUpdate pipapo_get() not to skip expired elements, otherwise flush\ncommand reports bogus ENOENT errors.",
