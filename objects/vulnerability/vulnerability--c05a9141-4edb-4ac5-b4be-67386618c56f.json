This vulnerability allows administrators with rights to perform actions (e.g., install a bundle) on a set of managed devices, to be able to exercise these rights on managed devices in the ZENworks zone but which are outside the scope of the administrator. This vulnerability does not result in the administrators gaining additional rights on the managed devices, either in the scope or outside the scope of the administrator.",
