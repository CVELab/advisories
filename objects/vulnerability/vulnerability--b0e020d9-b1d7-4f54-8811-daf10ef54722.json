            "description": "PingOne MFA Integration Kit contains a vulnerability related to the Prompt Users to Set Up MFA configuration. Under certain conditions, this configuration could allow for a new MFA device to be paired with a target user account without requiring second-factor authentication from the target’s existing registered devices. A threat actor might be able to exploit this vulnerability to register their own MFA device with a target user’s account if they have existing knowledge of the target user’s first factor credential.",
