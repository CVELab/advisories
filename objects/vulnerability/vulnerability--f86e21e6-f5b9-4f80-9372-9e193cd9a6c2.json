            "description": "wildfly-elytron: possible timing attacks via use of unsafe comparator. A flaw was found in Wildfly-elytron. Wildfly-elytron uses java.util.Arrays.equals in several places, which is unsafe and vulnerable to timing attacks. To compare values securely, use java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual instead. This flaw allows an attacker to access secure information or impersonate an authed user.",
