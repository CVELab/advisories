            "description": "An insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in the BentoML framework, allowing remote code execution (RCE) by sending a specially crafted POST request. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the BentoML application. The vulnerability is triggered when a serialized object, crafted to execute OS commands upon deserialization, is sent to any valid BentoML endpoint. This issue poses a significant security risk, enabling attackers to compromise the server and potentially gain unauthorized access or control.",
