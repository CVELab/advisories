            "description": "The vulnerability existed in the password storage of Mobateks MobaXterm below 25.0.\nMobaXTerm uses an initialization vector (IV) that is generated by encrypting null bytes with a derivate of the users master key. As both the master key is static, and AES ECB produces the same output with the same input the IV for AES CFB is always the same.The static IV makes it easier to obtain sensitive information and decrypt data if the data is stored at rest.",
