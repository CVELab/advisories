            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-400 H V6 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V6.0.10), SIMATIC S7-400 PN/DP V7 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-410 V10 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V10.1), SIMATIC S7-410 V8 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions). Affected devices improperly handle specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp. This could allow an attacker to create a Denial-of-Service condition. A restart is needed to restore normal operations.",
