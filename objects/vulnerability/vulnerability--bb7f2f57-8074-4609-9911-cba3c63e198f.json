The vulnerability is due to improper access restrictions on users who are added within user contacts. An attacker on one Webex Meetings site could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the Webex Meetings site. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the details of users on another Webex site, including user names and email addresses.",
