            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap\n\nWhen a trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU\ncouldn't execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on\nthe memory region.  In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched\nthe instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR)\nregister before calling the trap handler. So, the trap handler will find\nsome random old stale value in cr19.\n\nThis patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constant magic\n\"bad food\" value (0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to try to\nunderstand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.",
