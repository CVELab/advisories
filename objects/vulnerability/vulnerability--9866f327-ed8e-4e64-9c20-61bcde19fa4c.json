            "description": "If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.",
