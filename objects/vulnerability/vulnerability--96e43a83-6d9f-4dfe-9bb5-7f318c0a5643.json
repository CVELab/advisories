The cc26xx-web-demo features a webserver that runs on a constrained device. That particular page allows a user to remotely configure that device's operation by sending HTTP POST requests. The vulnerability consists of improper input sanitisation of the text fields on the MQTT/IBM Cloud config page, allowing for JavaScript code injection.",
