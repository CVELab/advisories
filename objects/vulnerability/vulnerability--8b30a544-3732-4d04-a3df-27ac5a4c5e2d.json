            "description": "A vulnerability in the API endpoints for Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information that should be restricted. The attacker must have valid device credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on API endpoints. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about other users who are configured with higher privileges on the application.",
