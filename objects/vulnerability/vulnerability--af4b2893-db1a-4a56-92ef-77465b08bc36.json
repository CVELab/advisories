This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of device configuration. The issue results from the storage of configuration secrets in plaintext. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
