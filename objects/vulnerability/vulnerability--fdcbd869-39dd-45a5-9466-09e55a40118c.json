            "description": "Rapid7 Metasploit Pro versions 4.21.2 and lower suffer from a stored cross site scripting vulnerability, due to a lack of JavaScript request string sanitization. Using this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the target browser against another Metasploit Pro user using a specially crafted request. Note that in most deployments, all Metasploit Pro users tend to enjoy privileges equivalent to local administrator.",
