            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.",
