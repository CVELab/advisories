            "description": "An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to insufficient firmware validation, an attacker can store malicious firmware code for the USB-to-SATA bridge controller on the USB drive (e.g., by leveraging physical access during the supply chain). This code is then executed. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.",
