            "description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper validation of user input in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor with administrative privileges can upload an arbitrary file to a user-controlled location on the server.\n\nBy leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could upload a specially crafted payload, potentially achieving remote code execution (RCE) on the server. Exploitation requires valid admin credentials, limiting its impact to authorized but potentially malicious users.",
