This vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web UI. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
