            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.4.0 and 8.4.1 allows context-dependent attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Outside In Filters.  NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft Access 1.x parser in vsacs.dll before 8.4.0.108 and before 8.4.1.52, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long field (aka column) name.",
