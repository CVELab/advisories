            "description": "In SoftMaker Software GmbH SoftMaker Office TextMaker 2021 (revision 1014), a specially crafted document can cause the document parser to miscalculate a length used to allocate a buffer, later upon usage of this buffer the application will write outside its bounds resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.",
