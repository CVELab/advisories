If a\npartially completed request is handled, then the\ndwc3_request->num_queued_sgs no longer reflects the total number of\nnum_queued_sgs (it would be cleared).\n\nCorrectly check the number of request SG entries remained to be prepare\nand queued. Failure to do this may cause null pointer dereference when\naccessing non-existent SG entry.",
