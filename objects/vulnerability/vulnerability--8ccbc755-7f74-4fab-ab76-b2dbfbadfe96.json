            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo\n\ntcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes\nto &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets\nca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced.\nThis has the unintended side-effect of changing the global\nnet.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that it\nis read-only: 97684f0970f6 (\"net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control\nreadonly in non-init netns\")\n\nResolve this netns \"leak\" by only allowing the init netns to set the\ndefault algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could be\nremoved if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the\nfuture.\n\nThis bug was uncovered with\nhttps://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify",
