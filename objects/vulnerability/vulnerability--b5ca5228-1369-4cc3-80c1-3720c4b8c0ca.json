For the Application Visibility and Reporting module, this may occur when the HTTP Analytics profile with URLs enabled under Collected Entities is configured on a virtual server and the DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI or avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are enabled. For BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM, this may occur when either a DoS or Bot Defense profile is configured on a virtual server and the DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI or avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are enabled.\n\nNote: The DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI and avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI are not enabled by default. For more information about the HTTP Analytics profile and the Collect URLs setting, refer to  K30875743: Create a new Analytics profile and attach it to your virtual servers https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K30875743 .\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated",
