            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npstore: ram_core: fix possible overflow in persistent_ram_init_ecc()\n\nIn persistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return\n64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t which\nis derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variable\nthis value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type.  Even if that\nvalue fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculating\nthe size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast to\nany 64-bit type before multiplication.  Declaring the ecc_blocks variable\nas *size_t* should fix this mess...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static\nanalysis tool.",
