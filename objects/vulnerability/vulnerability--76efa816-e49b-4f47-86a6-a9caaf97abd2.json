NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB03 occurs because RDBMS uses a NULL Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) for the Oracle process and certain shared memory sections, which allows local users to inject threads and execute arbitrary code via the OpenProcess, OpenThread, and SetThreadContext functions (DB03).",
