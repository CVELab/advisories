            "description": "VMware ESXi (6.7 before ESXi670-201904101-SG and 6.5 before ESXi650-201903001), Workstation (15.x before 15.0.3 and 14.x before 14.1.6), Fusion (11.x before 11.0.3 and 10.x before 10.1.6) contain multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the shader translator. Exploitation of these issues requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. Successful exploitation of these issues may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM. The workaround for these issues involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.",
