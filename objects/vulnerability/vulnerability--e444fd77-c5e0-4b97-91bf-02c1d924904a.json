Dumpable FPM child processes allow bypassing opcache access controls because fpm_unix.c makes a PR_SET_DUMPABLE prctl call, allowing one user (in a multiuser environment) to obtain sensitive information from the process memory of a second user's PHP applications by running gcore on the PID of the PHP-FPM worker process.",
