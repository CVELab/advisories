            "description": "A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 'imartinez/privategpt' repository due to improper validation of file uploads. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by uploading malicious HTML files, such as those containing JavaScript payloads, which are then executed in the context of the victim's session when accessed. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session, potentially resulting in phishing attacks or other malicious actions. The vulnerability affects the latest version of the repository.",
