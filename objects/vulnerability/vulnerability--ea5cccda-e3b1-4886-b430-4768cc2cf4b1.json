            "description": "The CHP Ads Block Detector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.9.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the chp_abd_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update or reset plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
