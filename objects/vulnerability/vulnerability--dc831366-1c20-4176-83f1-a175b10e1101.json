            "description": "When the 'bgp-error-tolerance' feature &#xe2;&#x80;\" designed to help mitigate remote session resets from malformed path attributes &#xe2;&#x80;\" is enabled, a BGP UPDATE containing a specifically crafted set of transitive attributes can cause the RPD routing process to crash and restart. Devices with BGP enabled that do not have 'bgp-error-tolerance' configured are not vulnerable to this issue.
