The vulnerability is due to weak login controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a brute-force attack (Repeated Bad Login Attempts). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restrict user access. Manual administrative intervention is required to restore access. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd07264.",
