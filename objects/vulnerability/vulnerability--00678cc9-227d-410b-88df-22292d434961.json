            "description": "The open-source identity infrastructure software Zitadel allows administrators to disable the user self-registration. ZITADEL's Admin API contains Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities that allow authenticated users, without specific IAM roles, to modify sensitive settings. While several endpoints are affected, the most critical vulnerability lies in the ability to manipulate LDAP configurations. Customers who do not utilize LDAP for authentication are not at risk from the most severe aspects of this vulnerability. However, upgrading to the patched version to address all identified issues is strongly recommended. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.0, 2.70.1, ,2.69.4, 2.68.4, 2.67.8, 2.66.11, 2.65.6, 2.64.5, and 2.63.8.",
