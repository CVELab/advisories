            "description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown a JSON blob instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.",
