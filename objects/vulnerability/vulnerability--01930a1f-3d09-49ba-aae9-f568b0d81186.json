            "description": "The User Registration & Membership â€“ Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the user_registration_pro_delete_account() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force delete users, including administrators, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
