The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to JAVA objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.",
