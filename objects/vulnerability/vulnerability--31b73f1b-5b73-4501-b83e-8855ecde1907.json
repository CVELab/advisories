            "description": "In tinysvcmdns through 2018-01-16, a maliciously crafted mDNS (Multicast DNS) packet triggers an infinite loop while parsing an mDNS query. When mDNS compressed labels point to each other, the function uncompress_nlabel goes into an infinite loop trying to analyze the packet with an mDNS query. As a result, the mDNS server hangs after receiving the malicious mDNS packet. NOTE: the product's web site states \"This project is un-maintained, and has been since 2013. ...
