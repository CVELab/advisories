            "description": "Medusa is an automatic video library manager for TV shows. Versions prior to 1.0.19 are vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). The `testDiscord` request handler in `medusa/server/web/home/handler.py` does not validate the user-controlled `discord_webhook` variable and passes it to the `notifiers.discord_notifier.test_notify` method, then `_notify_discord` and finally `_send_discord_msg` method,  which sends a POST request to the user-controlled URL on line 64 in `/medusa/notifiers/discord.py`, which leads to a blind server-side request forgery. This issue allows for crafting POST requests on behalf of the Medusa server. Version 1.0.19 contains a fix for the issue.",
