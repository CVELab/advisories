            "description": "A security defect in Foundry's Comments functionality resulted in the retrieval of attachments to comments not being gated by additional authorization checks. This could enable an authenticated user to inject a prior discovered attachment UUID into other arbitrary comments to discover it's content.\n\nThis defect was fixed in Foundry Comments 2.249.0, and a patch was rolled out to affected Foundry environments. No further intervention is required at this time.",
