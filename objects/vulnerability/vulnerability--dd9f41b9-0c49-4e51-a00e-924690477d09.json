            "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager could allow an authenticated application administrator to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of user input within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and then sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. A successful exploit could allow the authenticated attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.",
