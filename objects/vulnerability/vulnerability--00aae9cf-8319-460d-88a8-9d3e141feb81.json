Affected by this vulnerability is the function LWOImporter::GetS0 in the library assimp/code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOLoader.h. The manipulation of the argument out leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
