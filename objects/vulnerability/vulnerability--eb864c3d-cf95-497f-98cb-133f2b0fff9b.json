            "description": "The Email Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Hook Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 via the check_nonce function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute actions with hooks in WordPress under certain circumstances. The action the attacker wishes to execute needs to have a nonce check, and the nonce needs to be known to the attacker. Furthermore, the absence of a capability check is a requirement.",
