            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race\n\nThe SGX EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an\nenclave and set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG\nand ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for\nsecs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.\n\nFix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as\nneeded for both EAUG and ELDU.\n\nThe SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed\nwhen there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,\nvirtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is\npaged back in.\n\nAn enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS\npage. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race\nwith paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A\ntriggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS\nboth are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.\n\nHitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.\nFollowing is a trace when it happens.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\nRIP: 0010:sgx_encl_eaug_page+0xc7/0x210\nCall Trace:\n ? __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x16a/0x440\n ? xa_load+0x6e/0xa0\n sgx_vma_fault+0x119/0x230\n __do_fault+0x36/0x140\n do_fault+0x12f/0x400\n __handle_mm_fault+0x728/0x1110\n handle_mm_fault+0x105/0x310\n do_user_addr_fault+0x1ee/0x750\n ? __this_cpu_preempt_check+0x13/0x20\n exc_page_fault+0x76/0x180\n asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30",
