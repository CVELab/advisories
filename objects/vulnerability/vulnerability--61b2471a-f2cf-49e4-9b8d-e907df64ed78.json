            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite or read arbitrary files. The attacker would need valid administrator privilege-level credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of CLI command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques when executing a vulnerable command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or read arbitrary files on an affected device.",
