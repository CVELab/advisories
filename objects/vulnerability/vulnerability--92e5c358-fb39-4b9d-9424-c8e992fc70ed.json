            "description": "Gatsby is a framework for building websites. The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`. One may manually edit the app.js file post-build as a workaround.",
