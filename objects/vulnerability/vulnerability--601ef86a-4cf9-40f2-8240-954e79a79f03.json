The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.",
