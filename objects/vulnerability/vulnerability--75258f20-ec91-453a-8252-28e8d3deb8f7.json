Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the \"require moderator approval of all new topics\" setting set. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16.",
