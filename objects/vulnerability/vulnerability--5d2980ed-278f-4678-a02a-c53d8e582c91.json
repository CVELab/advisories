The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the interface and viewing restricted portions of the software configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information or conduct further attacks.",
