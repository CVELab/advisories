            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the CLI parser subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by exceeding the expected length of user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
