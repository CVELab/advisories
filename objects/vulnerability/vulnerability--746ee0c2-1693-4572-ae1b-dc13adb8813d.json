            "description": "A vulnerability in a specific CLI command implementation of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape a restricted shell on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when issuing a specific CLI command with parameters on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device CLI and issuing certain commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability only affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switches that are running a release prior to 14.0(3d).",
