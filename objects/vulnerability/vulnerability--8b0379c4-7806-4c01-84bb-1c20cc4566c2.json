The vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific command at the command line. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information within the configuration that otherwise might not have been accessible beyond the privileges of the invoking user.",
