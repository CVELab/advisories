            "description": "An MS-MPC or MS-MIC Service PIC may crash when large fragmented packets are passed through an Application Layer Gateway (ALG). Repeated crashes of the Service PC can result in an extended denial of service condition. The issue can be seen only if NAT or stateful-firewall rules are configured with ALGs enabled.
