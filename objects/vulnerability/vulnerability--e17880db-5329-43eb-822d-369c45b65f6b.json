            "description": "Apache Olingo versions 4.0.0 to 4.7.0 provide the AsyncRequestWrapperImpl class which reads a URL from the Location header, and then sends a GET or DELETE request to this URL. It may allow to implement a SSRF attack. If an attacker tricks a client to connect to a malicious server, the server can make the client call any URL including internal resources which are not directly accessible by the attacker.",
