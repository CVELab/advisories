Starting in version 3.1-milestone-1, any user can edit their own profile and inject code, which is going to be executed with programming right. The same vulnerability can also be exploited in all other places where short text properties are displayed, e.g., in apps created using Apps Within Minutes that use a short text field. The problem has been patched on versions 13.10.9, 14.4.4, 14.7RC1.",
