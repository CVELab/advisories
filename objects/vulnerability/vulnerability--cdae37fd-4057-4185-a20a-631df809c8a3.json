            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format\n\nEROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each\nper-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk\nsuperblock for initialization.\n\nHowever, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use\nan unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA\nalgorithmtype even it's not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`.  This\ncan lead to an unexpected \"BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference\" if\nthe corresponding decompressor isn't built-in.\n\nFix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs` for each\nm_algorithmformat request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset\nbitmap is now fixed together since it was harmless previously.",
