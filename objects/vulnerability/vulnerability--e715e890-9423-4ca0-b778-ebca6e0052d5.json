            "description": "The SVS Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the deletePricingTable() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete pricing tables via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
