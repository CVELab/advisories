A specially-crafted UPnP negotiation can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker can host a malicious UPnP service to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via `errorCode` and `errorDescription` XML tags, as used within the `DoUpdateUPnPbyService` action handler.",
