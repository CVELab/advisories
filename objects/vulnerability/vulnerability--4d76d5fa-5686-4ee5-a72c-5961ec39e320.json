            "description": "A vulnerability in the IOx application environment of multiple Cisco platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing HTTPS requests, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a Transport Layer Security (TLS) implementation issue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS packets to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing HTTPS requests, resulting in a DoS condition.",
