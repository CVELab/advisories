            "description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
