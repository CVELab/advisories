The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of requests that are sent to the iperf tool. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the iperf tool, which is included in Cisco SD-WAN Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain any file from the filesystem of an affected device.",
