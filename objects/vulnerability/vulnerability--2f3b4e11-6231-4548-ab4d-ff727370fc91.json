            "description": "Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships with the default administrator credentials as `admin` and password as `admin`. This allows Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the `admin` password. There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change the password, many steps are required.",
