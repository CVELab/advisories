            "description": "Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos Era 100 smart speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2 messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22384.",
