The vulnerability is due to incorrect permission settings in affected DCNM software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading specially crafted data to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem and execute code with root privileges on the affected device.",
