            "description": "In Contiki 3.0, Telnet option negotiation is mishandled. During negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted.",
