            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/rds: fix possible cp null dereference\n\ncp might be null, calling cp->cp_conn would produce null dereference\n\n[Simon Horman adds:]\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* cp is a parameter of __rds_rdma_map and is not reassigned.\n\n* The following call-sites pass a NULL cp argument to __rds_rdma_map()\n\n  - rds_get_mr()\n  - rds_get_mr_for_dest\n\n* Prior to the code above, the following assumes that cp may be NULL\n  (which is indicative, but could itself be unnecessary)\n\n\ttrans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr(\n\t\tsg, nents, rs, &mr->r_key, cp ? cp->cp_conn : NULL,\n\t\targs->vec.addr, args->vec.bytes,\n\t\tneed_odp ? ODP_ZEROBASED : ODP_NOT_NEEDED);\n\n* The code modified by this patch is guarded by IS_ERR(trans_private),\n  where trans_private is assigned as per the previous point in this analysis.\n\n  The only implementation of get_mr that I could locate is rds_ib_get_mr()\n  which can return an ERR_PTR if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.\n\n* ret is set to PTR_ERR(trans_private).\n  rds_ib_get_mr can return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.\n  Thus ret may be -ENODEV in which case the code in question will execute.\n\nConclusion:\n* cp may be NULL at the point where this patch adds a check;\n  this patch does seem to address a possible bug",
