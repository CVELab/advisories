Lack of anti-glitch mitigations in the first stage bootloader of the ESP32 chip allows an attacker (with physical access to the device) to read the contents of read-protected eFuses, such as flash encryption and secure boot keys, by injecting a glitch into the power supply of the chip shortly after reset.",
