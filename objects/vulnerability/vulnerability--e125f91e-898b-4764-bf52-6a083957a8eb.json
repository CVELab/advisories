Remote attackers with low-privilege user accounts for backend access are able to inject malicious script codes into the `TWG Explorer` item listing. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the service. The injection point is the add/create input field and the execution point occurs in the item listing after the add or create.",
