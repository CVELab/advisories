            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: qcom: qmp-usb-legacy: fix NULL-deref on runtime suspend\n\nCommit 413db06c05e7 (\"phy: qcom-qmp-usb: clean up probe initialisation\")\nremoved most users of the platform device driver data from the\nqcom-qmp-usb driver, but mistakenly also removed the initialisation\ndespite the data still being used in the runtime PM callbacks. This bug\nwas later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the\nqmp-usb-legacy driver.\n\nRestore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointer\ndereference on runtime suspend.\n\nApparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabled\nmanually through sysfs, with these drivers.",
