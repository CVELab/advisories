A manipulated PC Worx or Config+ project file could lead to an Out-Of-Bounds Read, Information Disclosure, and remote code execution. The attacker needs to get access to an original PC Worx or Config+ project file to be able to manipulate it. After manipulation, the attacker needs to exchange the original file with the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.",
