            "description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process.",
