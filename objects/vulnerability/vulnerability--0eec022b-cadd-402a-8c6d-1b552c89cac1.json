            "description": "On Triangle MicroWorks' SCADA Data Gateway version <= v5.01.03, an unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted broadcast message including format string characters to the SCADA Data Gateway to perform unrestricted memory reads.An unauthenticated user can use this format string vulnerability to repeatedly crash the GTWWebMonitor.exe process to DoS the Web Monitor.  Furthermore, an authenticated user can leverage this vulnerability to leak memory from the GTWWebMonitor.exe process. This could be leveraged in an exploit chain to gain code execution.",
