            "description": "The Confetti Fall Animation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'confetti-fall-animation' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
