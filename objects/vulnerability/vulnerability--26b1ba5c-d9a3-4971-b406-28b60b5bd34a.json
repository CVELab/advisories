            "description": "On F5 BIG-IP 13.0.0-13.1.0.5 or 12.0.0-12.1.3.3, malicious root users with access to a VCMP guest can cause a disruption of service on adjacent VCMP guests running on the same host. Exploiting this vulnerability causes the vCMPd process on the adjacent VCMP guest to restart and produce a core file. This issue is only exploitable on a VCMP guest which is operating in \"host-only\" or \"bridged\" mode. VCMP guests which are \"isolated\" are not impacted by this issue and do not provide mechanism to exploit the vulnerability. Guests which are deployed in \"Appliance Mode\" may be impacted however the exploit is not possible from an Appliance Mode guest. To exploit this vulnerability root access on a guest system deployed as \"host-only\" or \"bridged\" mode is required.",
