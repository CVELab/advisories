            "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco ASR 900 and ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to incorrect programming of hardware when an ACL is configured using a method other than the configuration CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.",
