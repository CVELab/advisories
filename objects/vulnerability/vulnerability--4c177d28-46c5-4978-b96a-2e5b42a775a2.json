            "description": "Citrix Federated Authentication Service (FAS) 7.17 - 10.6 causes deployments that have been configured to store a registration authority certificate's private key in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to incorrectly store that key in the Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider (MSKSP). This issue only occurs if PowerShell was used when configuring FAS to store the registration authority certificateâ€™s private key in the TPM. It does not occur if the TPM was not selected for use or if the FAS administration console was used for configuration.",
