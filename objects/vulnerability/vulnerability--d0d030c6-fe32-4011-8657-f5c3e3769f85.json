            "description": "The User Registration, Login & Landing Pages WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the loader_text parameter found in the ~/includes/templates/landing-page.php file which allows attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.2.7. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
