            "description": "passport-wsfed-saml2 provides passport strategy for both WS-fed and SAML2 protocol. A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by tampering with a valid SAML response. This can be done by adding attributes to the response. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using `passport-wsfed-saml2` and a valid SAML Response signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability.",
