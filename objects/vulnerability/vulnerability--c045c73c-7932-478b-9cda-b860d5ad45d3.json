            "description": "The default configuration of Uber Uploader (UU) 5.3.6 and earlier does not block uploads of (1) .html, (2) .asp, and other possibly dangerous extensions, which allows remote attackers to use these extensions in uploads via (a) uu_file_upload.php, related to uu_file_upload.js and (b) uber_uploader_file.php, related to uber_uploader_file.js, a different issue than CVE-2007-0123.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the severity of the issue, noting that it is the administrator's responsibility to \"add file extensions that you may or may not want uploaded.\"",
