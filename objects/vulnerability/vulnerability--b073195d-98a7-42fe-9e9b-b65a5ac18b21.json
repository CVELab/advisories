            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failure\n\nEach add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence.  In\nthe error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences\ngot leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't\nfreeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always\nzero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on\nevery error path.",
