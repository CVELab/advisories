            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state\n\nCurrently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub from\nudev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub.\nHowever, in case the actconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would\nbe NULL and upon further accessing to get port_dev would result in null\npointer dereference.\n\nFix this by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.",
