Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. OpenAPI Generator maven plug-in creates insecure temporary files during the process. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.",
