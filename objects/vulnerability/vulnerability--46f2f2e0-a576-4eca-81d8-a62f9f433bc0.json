If the attacker convinces an authenticated user with a currently active session to enter or click on the URL the commands will be executed on the affected system. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Managed File Transfer Command Center: versions 8.2.1 and below and TIBCO Managed File Transfer Internet Server: versions 8.2.1 and below.",
