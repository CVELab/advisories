            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsdax: dax_unshare_iter needs to copy entire blocks\n\nThe code that copies data from srcmap to iomap in dax_unshare_iter is\nvery very broken, which bfoster's recent fsx changes have exposed.\n\nIf the pos and len passed to dax_file_unshare are not aligned to an\nfsblock boundary, the iter pos and length in the _iter function will\nreflect this unalignment.\n\ndax_iomap_direct_access always returns a pointer to the start of the\nkmapped fsdax page, even if its pos argument is in the middle of that\npage.  This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not\naligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in\nthe file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the\nwrong place.\n\nIf iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a\npage, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the\ndestination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality\nbecause we expose stale pmem contents.\n\nFix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page\nboundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that\nwe always copy full blocks.\n\nWe're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,\nso programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the\nold memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.\n\nBe careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still\nneed to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're\noperating on.",
