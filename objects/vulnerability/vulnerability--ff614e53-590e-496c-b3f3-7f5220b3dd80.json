            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious .arf or .wrf file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user. These vulnerabilities affect ARF and WRF recording players available from Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server.
