An attacker without authentication is able to execute arbitrary SQL SELECT statements by injecting the HTTP (POST or GET) parameter persoid into /tools/VamPersonPhoto.php. The SQL Injection type is Error-based (this means that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database).",
