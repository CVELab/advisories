            "description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
