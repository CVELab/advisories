            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: qfq: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc\n\nAs described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netem\nchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.\nIn the case of qfq, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the same\nclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.\n\nThis patch checks whether the class was already added to the agg->active\nlist (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant\ncase.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",
