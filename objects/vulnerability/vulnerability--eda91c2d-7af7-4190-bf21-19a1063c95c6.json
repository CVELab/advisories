            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17 and earlier, 6 Update 43 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 41 and earlier; and OpenJDK 6 and 7; allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to RMI.  NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to the default java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly setting of false, which allows remote attackers to perform \"dynamic class downloading\" and execute arbitrary code.",
