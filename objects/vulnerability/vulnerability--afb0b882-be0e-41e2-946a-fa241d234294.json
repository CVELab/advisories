            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndriver core: Fix wait_for_device_probe() & deferred_probe_timeout interaction\n\nMounting NFS rootfs was timing out when deferred_probe_timeout was\nnon-zero [1].  This was because ip_auto_config() initcall times out\nwaiting for the network interfaces to show up when\ndeferred_probe_timeout was non-zero. While ip_auto_config() calls\nwait_for_device_probe() to make sure any currently running deferred\nprobe work or asynchronous probe finishes, that wasn't sufficient to\naccount for devices being deferred until deferred_probe_timeout.\n\nCommit 35a672363ab3 (\"driver core: Ensure wait_for_device_probe() waits\nuntil the deferred_probe_timeout fires\") tried to fix that by making\nsure wait_for_device_probe() waits for deferred_probe_timeout to expire\nbefore returning.\n\nHowever, if wait_for_device_probe() is called from the kernel_init()\ncontext:\n\n- Before deferred_probe_initcall() [2], it causes the boot process to\n  hang due to a deadlock.\n\n- After deferred_probe_initcall() [3], it blocks kernel_init() from\n  continuing till deferred_probe_timeout expires and beats the point of\n  deferred_probe_timeout that's trying to wait for userspace to load\n  modules.\n\nNeither of this is good. So revert the changes to\nwait_for_device_probe().\n\n[1] - https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/TYAPR01MB45443DF63B9EF29054F7C41FD8C60@TYAPR01MB4544.jpnprd01.prod.outlook.com/\n[2] - https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YowHNo4sBjr9ijZr@dev-arch.thelio-3990X/\n[3] - https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yo3WvGnNk3LvLb7R@linutronix.de/",
