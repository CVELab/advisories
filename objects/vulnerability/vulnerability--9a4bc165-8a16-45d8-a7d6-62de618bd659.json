            "description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in haotian-liu/llava v1.2.0 (LLaVA-1.6) allows an attacker to upload files with malicious content without authentication or user interaction. The uploaded file is stored in a predictable path, enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by visiting the crafted file URL. This can lead to theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or other actions compromising the security and privacy of the victim.",
