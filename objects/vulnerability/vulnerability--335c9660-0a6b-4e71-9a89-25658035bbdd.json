            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()\n\nWhen performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the\n/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix\nlength is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,\ntriggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not\napply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.",
