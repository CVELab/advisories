This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several unauthorized actions like deactivating the plugin, disconnecting the subscription, syncing the status and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
