            "description": "A vulnerability has been discovered in Xiaomi routers that could allow command injection through an external interface. This vulnerability arises from inadequate filtering of responses returned from the external interface. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by hijacking the ISP or an upper-layer router to gain privileges on the Xiaomi router. Successful exploitation of this flaw could permit remote code execution and complete compromise of the device.",
