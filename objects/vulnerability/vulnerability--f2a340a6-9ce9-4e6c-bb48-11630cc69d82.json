            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to manipulate file names within the messaging interface. The vulnerability exists because the affected software mishandles character rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sharing a file within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify how the shared file name displays within the interface, which could allow the attacker to conduct phishing or spoofing attacks.",
