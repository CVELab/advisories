            "description": "In TP-Link Omada er605 1.0.1 through (v2.6) 2.2.3, a cloud-brd binary is susceptible to an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. After heap shaping, an attacker can achieve code execution in the context of the cloud-brd binary that runs at the root level. This is fixed in ER605(UN)_v2_2.2.4 Build 020240119.",
