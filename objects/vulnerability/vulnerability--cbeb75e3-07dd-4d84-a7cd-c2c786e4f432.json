Prior to versions 13.10.5 and 14.3, it is possible to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack for adding or removing tags on XWiki pages. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3. As a workaround, one may locally modify the `documentTags.vm` template in one's filesystem, to apply the changes exposed there.",
