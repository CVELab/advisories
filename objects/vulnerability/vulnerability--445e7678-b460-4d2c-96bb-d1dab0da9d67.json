            "description": "A vulnerability in 802.11 Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME) action frame processing in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 WME packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed 802.11 WME frames to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the WLC to reload unexpectedly. The fixed versions are 8.0.140.0, 8.2.130.0, and 8.3.111.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva86353.",
