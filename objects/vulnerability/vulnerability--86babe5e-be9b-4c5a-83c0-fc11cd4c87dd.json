            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncgroup/cpuset: Fix wrong check in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()\n\nIt was found that the check to see if a partition could use up all\nthe cpus from the parent cpuset in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()\nwas incorrect. As a result, it is possible to leave parent with no\neffective cpu left even if there are tasks in the parent cpuset. This\ncan lead to system panic as reported in [1].\n\nFix this probem by updating the check to fail the enabling the partition\nif parent's effective_cpus is a subset of the child's cpus_allowed.\n\nAlso record the error code when an error happens in update_prstate()\nand add a test case where parent partition and child have the same cpu\nlist and parent has task. Enabling partition in the child will fail in\nthis case.\n\n[1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/cgroups/msg36254.html",
