            "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected Tesla vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the wowlan_config data structure. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-17543.",
