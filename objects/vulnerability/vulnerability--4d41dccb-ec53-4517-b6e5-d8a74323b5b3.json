            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: fix hang in nfsd4_shutdown_callback\n\nIf nfs4_client is in courtesy state then there is no point to send\nthe callback. This causes nfsd4_shutdown_callback to hang since\ncl_cb_inflight is not 0. This hang lasts about 15 minutes until TCP\nnotifies NFSD that the connection was dropped.\n\nThis patch modifies nfsd4_run_cb_work to skip the RPC call if\nnfs4_client is in courtesy state.",
