            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission\n\nMPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field\nis protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain\nsocket lock.\n\nCurrently we have a code path updating such field without handling\nthe relevant lock:\n\n__mptcp_retrans() -> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()\n\nSeveral helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update\nsk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, as reported\nby Matthieu.\n\nAddress the issue providing and using a new variant of blamed function\nwhich explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.",
