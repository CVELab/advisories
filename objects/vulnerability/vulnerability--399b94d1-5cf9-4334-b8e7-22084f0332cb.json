            "description": "An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to lack of size validation. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a URI longer than 50 bytes. This leads to a heap overflow in wbs_post() via an strcpy() call.",
