            "description": "A vulnerability in the archive utility of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of paths that are embedded within archive files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files in the system with the privileges of the logged-in user.",
