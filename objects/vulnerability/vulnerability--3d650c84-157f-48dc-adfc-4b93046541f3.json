            "description": "The ImageMagick Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution via the 'cli_path' parameter in versions up to, and including 1.7.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to run arbitrary commands leading to remote command execution, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This makes it possible for an attacker to create and or modify files hosted on the server which can easily grant attackers backdoor access to the affected server.",
