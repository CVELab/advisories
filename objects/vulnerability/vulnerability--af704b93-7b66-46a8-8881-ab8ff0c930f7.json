            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout\n\nWhile the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it to\ncollect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is being\nreleased from the commit path.\n\nMingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x\nwith a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since\n7395dfacfff6 (\"netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set\nelement timeout\").\n\nFix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc\nin this case.\n\nAccording to 08e4c8c5919f (\"netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on\ntransaction abort\"), Florian plans to accelerate abort path by releasing\nobjects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort\npath too.",
