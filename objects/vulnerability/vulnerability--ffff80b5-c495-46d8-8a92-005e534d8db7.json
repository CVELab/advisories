            "description": "Dimension versions 3.4.11 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious file into the search path, which the application might execute instead of the legitimate file. This could occur if the application uses a search path to locate executables or libraries. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction.",
