            "description": "URLs using \"javascript:\" have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the \"javascript:\" URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.",
