            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage\n\nThe below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory\nregion with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].\n\ncompact_zone()\t\t\tmemunmap_pages\n-------------\t\t\t---------------\n__pageblock_pfn_to_page\n   ......\n (a)pfn_valid():\n     valid_section()//return true\n\t\t\t      (b)__remove_pages()->\n\t\t\t\t  sparse_remove_section()->\n\t\t\t\t    section_deactivate():\n\t\t\t\t    [Free the array ms->usage and set\n\t\t\t\t     ms->usage = NULL]\n     pfn_section_valid()\n     [Access ms->usage which\n     is NULL]\n\nNOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between\nthe pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with\nSPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.\n\nThe commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with\npfn_section_valid check\") tried to address the same problem by clearing\nthe SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns\nfalse thus ms->usage is not accessed.\n\nFix this issue by the below steps:\n\na) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage.\n\nb) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL\n   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage.\n\nc) Free the ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL.  No\n   attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the\n   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.\n\nThanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/\n\nOn Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch of\nissues daily while testing on a device farm.\n\nFor this particular issue below is the log.
