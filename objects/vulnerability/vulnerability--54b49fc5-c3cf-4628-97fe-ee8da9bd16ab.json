            "description": "The W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.1 through the publicly exposed debug log file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information in the exposed log file. For example, the log file may contain nonce values that can be used in further CSRF attacks.\r\nNote: the debug feature must be enabled for this to be a concern, and it is disabled by default.",
