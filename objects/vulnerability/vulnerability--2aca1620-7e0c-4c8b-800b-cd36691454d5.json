            "description": "syslog-ng is an enhanced log daemo. Prior to version 4.8.2, `tls_wildcard_match()` matches on certificates such as `foo.*.bar` although that is not allowed. It is also possible to pass partial wildcards such as `foo.a*c.bar` which glib matches but should be avoided / invalidated. This issue could have an impact on TLS connections, such as in man-in-the-middle situations. Version 4.8.2 contains a fix for the issue.",
