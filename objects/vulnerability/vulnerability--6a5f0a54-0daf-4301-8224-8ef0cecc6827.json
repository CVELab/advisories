            "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the DXF file reading procedure in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2023.6. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied XRecord data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
