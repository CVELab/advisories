            "description": "The Backup and Restore feature in Mobotap Dolphin Browser for Android 12.0.2 suffers from an arbitrary file write vulnerability when attempting to restore browser settings from a malicious Dolphin Browser backup file. This arbitrary file write vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite a specific executable in the Dolphin Browser's data directory with a crafted malicious executable. Every time the Dolphin Browser is launched, it will attempt to run the malicious executable from disk, thus executing the attacker's code.",
