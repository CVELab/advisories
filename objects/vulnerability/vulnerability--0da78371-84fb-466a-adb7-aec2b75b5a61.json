The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of URL requests by the REST API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the REST API of the affected software on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CDB process on the affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77571.",
