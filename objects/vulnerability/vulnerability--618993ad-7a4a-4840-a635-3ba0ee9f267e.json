            "description": "Rostelecom CS-C2SHW 5.0.082.1 is affected by: Bash command injection. The camera reads configuration from QR code (including network settings). The static IP configuration from QR code is copied to the file /config/ip-static and after reboot data from this file is inserted into bash command (without any escaping). So bash injection is possible. Camera doesn't parse QR codes if it's already successfully configured. Camera is always rebooted after successful configuration via QR code.",
