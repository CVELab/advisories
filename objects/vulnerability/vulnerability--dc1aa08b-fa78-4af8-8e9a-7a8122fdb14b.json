            "description": "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file\ntype when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system\nimage and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes \nor sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image\n(such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An \nattacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which\ncontained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block\nindefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.",
