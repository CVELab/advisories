            "description": "The IQ Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'process_image_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can only be exploited if the 'gd' php extension is not loaded on the server.",
