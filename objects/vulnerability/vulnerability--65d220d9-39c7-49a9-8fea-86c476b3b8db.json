            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpt3sas: Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()\n\nPort is allocated by sas_port_alloc_num() and rphy is allocated by either\nsas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc(), all of which may return\nNULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.\n\nIf sas_rphy_add() returned with failure, rphy is set to NULL. We would\naccess the rphy in the following lines which would also result NULL pointer\naccess.",
