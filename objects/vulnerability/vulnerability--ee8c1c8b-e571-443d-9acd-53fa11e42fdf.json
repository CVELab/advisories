            "description": "A vulnerability in the IOS daemon (IOSd) web-based management interface of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
