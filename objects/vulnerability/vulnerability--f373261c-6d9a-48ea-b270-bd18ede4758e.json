            "description": "A Out-of-bounds Write issue affecting the v2_sdk_service running on a set of DJI drone devices on the port 10000 could allow an attacker to overwrite a pointer in the process memory through a crafted payload triggering an unsafe memory write operation in the my_tcp_receive function implemented in the libv2_sdk.so library used by the dji_vtwo_sdk binary implementing the service, potentially leading to a memory information leak or to an arbitrary code execution. Affected models are Mavic 3 Pro until v01.01.0300, Mavic 3 until v01.00.1200, Mavic 3 Classic until v01.00.0500, Mavic 3 Enterprise until v07.01.10.03, Matrice 300 until v57.00.01.00, Matrice M30 until v07.01.0022 and Mini 3 Pro until v01.00.0620.",
