The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of VPN traffic by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted VPN traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to hang or crash, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd39267.",
