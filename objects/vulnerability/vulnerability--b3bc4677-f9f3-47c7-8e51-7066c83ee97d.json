            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 20.0 Build: 4201.2111.1802.0000 Service Pack 2. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of APP files. Crafted data in a APP file can cause the application to execute arbitrary Visual Basic scripts. The user interface fails to provide sufficient indication of the hazard. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17370.",
