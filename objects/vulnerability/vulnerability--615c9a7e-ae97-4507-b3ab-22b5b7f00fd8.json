            "description": "This vulnerability involves command injection in tcpdump within Moxa products, enabling an authenticated attacker with console access to exploit improper input validation to inject and execute systems commands. Successful exploitation could result in privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain root shell access and maintain persistent control over the device, potentially disrupting network services and affecting the availability of downstream systems that rely on its connectivity.",
