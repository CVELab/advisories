            "description": "A vulnerability in the system file permission handling of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite critical system files, which could cause a DoS condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a race condition with handling system files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing specific operations on the file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite system files, which could lead to the device being in an inconsistent state and cause a DoS condition.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
