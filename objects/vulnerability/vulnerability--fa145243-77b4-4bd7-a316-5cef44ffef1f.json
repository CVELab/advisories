            "description": "When the Amazon Redshift Python Connector is configured with the BrowserAzureOAuth2CredentialsProvider plugin, the driver skips the SSL certificate validation step for the Identity Provider. An insecure connection could allow an actor to intercept the token exchange process and retrieve an access token.\n\nThis issue has been addressed in driver version 2.1.7. Users should upgrade to address this issue and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.",
