            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.0.0.29935. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPEG images embedded inside U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5422.",
