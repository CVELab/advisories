            "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the CLI on a device that is running ConfD could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.\r\n The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a process argument on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting commands during the execution of this process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privilege level of ConfD, which is commonly root.",
