            "description": "IrfanView SID File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of SID files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-23277.",
