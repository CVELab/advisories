            "description": "The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to product price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter 'product_tmp_two' for computing a security hash against price tampering while using 'wspsc_product' to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item.",
