            "description": "Netgear RAX43 version 1.0.3.96 makes use of hardcoded credentials. It does not appear that normal users are intended to be able to manipulate configuration backups due to the fact that they are encrypted. This encryption is accomplished via a password-protected zip file with a hardcoded password (RAX50w!a4udk). By unzipping the configuration using this password, a user can reconfigure settings not intended to be manipulated, re-zip the configuration, and restore a backup causing these settings to be changed.",
