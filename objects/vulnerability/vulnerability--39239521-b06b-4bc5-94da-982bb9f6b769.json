            "description": "Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator versions prior to 8.9.11+, 8.10.11+, or 9.0.1+ uses HTTP headers to authenticate REST API calls from localhost. This makes it possible to log in to Orchestrator by introducing an HTTP HOST header set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost. Orchestrator instances that are hosted by customers –on-premise or in a public cloud provider –are affected by this vulnerability.",
