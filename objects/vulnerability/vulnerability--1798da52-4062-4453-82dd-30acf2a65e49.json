            "description": "A vulnerability in the processing of inbound IPv6 packets in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 switches may cause the memory to not be freed, leading to a packet DMA memory leak, and eventual Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThe following error logs may be observed using the \"show heap\" command and the device may eventually run out of memory if such packets are received continuously.\n\n\n  Jan 12 12:00:00 device-name fpc0 (buf alloc) failed allocating packet buffer\n  Jan 12 12:00:01 device-name fpc0 (buf alloc) failed allocating packet buffer\n\n\n  user@device-name> request pfe execute target fpc0 timeout 30 command \"show heap\"\n\n\n  ID        Base      Total(b)       Free(b)       Used(b)   %   Name\n  --  ----------   -----------   -----------   -----------  --- -----------\n  0    246fc1a8     536870488     353653752     183216736   34  Kernel\n  1    91800000      16777216      12069680       4707536   28  DMA\n  2    92800000      75497472      69997640       5499832    7  PKT DMA DESC\n  3    106fc000     335544320     221425960     114118360   34  Bcm_sdk\n  4    97000000     176160768           200     176160568   99  Packet DMA <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n  5    903fffe0      20971504      20971504             0    0  Blob\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series, EX4600:\n18.3R3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S3;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S6;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S1, 21.1R3;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS:\nAny versions prior to 17.4R3;\n18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S6;\n18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3;\n18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2.",
