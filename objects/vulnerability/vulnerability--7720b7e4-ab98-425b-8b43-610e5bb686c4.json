            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix potential use-after-free in work function\n\nWhen a reset notify IPC message is received, the ISR schedules a work\nfunction and passes the ISHTP device to it via a global pointer\nishtp_dev. If ish_probe() fails, the devm-managed device resources\nincluding ishtp_dev are freed, but the work is not cancelled, causing a\nuse-after-free when the work function tries to access ishtp_dev. Use\ndevm_work_autocancel() instead, so that the work is automatically\ncancelled if probe fails.",
