            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform, Cisco BroadWorks Application Server, and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
