            "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49. It writes \"ps auxwwe\" output to the /var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log file. This may, for example, unexpectedly write credentials (from environment variables) to disk in cleartext. NOTE: there are no common circumstances in which qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log can be read by a user other than root; however, the file contents could be exposed through site-specific operational practices. The vendor does NOT characterize this as a vulnerability because the ps data collection is intentional, and would only capture credentials on a machine that was already affected by the CWE-214 weakness.",
