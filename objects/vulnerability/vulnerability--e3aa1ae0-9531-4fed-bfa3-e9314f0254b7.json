            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlz4: fix LZ4_decompress_safe_partial read out of bound\n\nWhen partialDecoding, it is EOF if we've either filled the output buffer\nor can't proceed with reading an offset for following match.\n\nIn some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted,\nUAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial\nmay lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has\nfixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.\n\ncurrent decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping\nlib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd\nbetter fix it first.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000830d1205cf7f0477@google.com/\n[2] https://github.com/lz4/lz4/commit/c5d6f8a8be3927c0bec91bcc58667a6cfad244ad#\n[3] https://lore.kernel.org/all/CC666AE8-4CA4-4951-B6FB-A2EFDE3AC03B@fb.com/",
