            "description": "An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.",
