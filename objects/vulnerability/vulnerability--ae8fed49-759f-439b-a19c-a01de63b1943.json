            "description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause 100% CPU load and the device to become unresponsive by sending a flood of traffic to the out-of-band management ethernet port.\n\nContinued receipted of a flood will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the flood subsides the system will recover by itself.\n\nAn indication that the system is affected by this issue would be that an irq handled by the fman process is shown to be using a high percentage of CPU cycles like in the following example output:\n\n  user@host> show system processes extensive\n  ...\n  PID USERNAME PRI NICE SIZE   RES STATE   TIME WCPU COMMAND\n  31 root   -84 -187   0K   16K WAIT   22.2H 56939.26% irq96: fman0\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:\nAll versions prior to 18.3R3-S6;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S5;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2.",
