            "description": "An insufficient certification validation issue in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app enables attackers to connect the GlobalProtect app to arbitrary servers. This can enable a local non-administrative operating system user or an attacker on the same subnet to install malicious root certificates on the endpoint and subsequently install malicious software signed by the malicious root certificates on that endpoint.\n\nGlobalProtect App for Android is under evaluation. Please subscribe to  our RSS feed https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/rss.xml  to be alerted to new updates to this and other advisories.",
