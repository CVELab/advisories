            "description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Server before 6.5.5 have unknown impact and attack vectors, due to \"potential security issues\" as identified by SPR numbers (1) GPKS6C9J67 in Agents, (2) JGAN6B6TZ3 and (3) KSPR699NBP in the Router, (4) GPKS5YQGPT in Security, or (5) HSAO6BNL6Y in the Web Server. NOTE: vector 3 is related to an issue in NROUTER in IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Server before 6.5.4 FP1, 6.5.5, and 7.0, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted vCal meeting request sent via SMTP (aka SPR# KSPR699NBP).",
