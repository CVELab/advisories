            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: caiaq: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection\n\nThe USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long\nwaiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at\ndisconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it\ncan take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which\nmay trigger a soft lockup.\n\nAn easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with\nsnd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while\nthe release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device\nrelease at the last close.\n\nThis patch also splits the code to the disconnect and the free phases;\nthe former is called immediately at the USB disconnect callback while\nthe latter is called from the card destructor.",
