            "description": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes.",
