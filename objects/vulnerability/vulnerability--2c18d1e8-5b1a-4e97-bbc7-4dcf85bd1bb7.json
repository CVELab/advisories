            "description": "A flaw was found in Stackrox, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the script code is included in a small subset of table cells. The only known potential exploit is if the script is included in the name of a Kubernetes “Role” object* that is applied to a secured cluster. This object can be used by a user with access to the cluster or through a compromised third-party product.",
