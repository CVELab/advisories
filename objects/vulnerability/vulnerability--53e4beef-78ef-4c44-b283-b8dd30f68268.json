            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues\n\nUsing not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.\nIgnore the skb priority for those cards, they only have one tx queue. Pierre\nAsselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:\n\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html\n\nHe also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:\n\nAfter updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a\n\"divide error: 0000\" when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to\nuse IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority, which wpa_supplicants starts to use in\n2.10.\n\nSince only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS, the priority\nof the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185\ncards.\n\nrtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on\ndrivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this\npatch:\n\tidx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries\n\n\"ring->entries\" is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards, tx_ring[2] never got\ninitialized.",
