            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path\n\nIn export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a\ndma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handling\nin udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about\nthe containing dma_buf.\n\nThis leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; though\nthat doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.\n\nFix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we\ncan give it different error handling.\n\nNote that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21\n(\"udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios\"); but the memory leak\nseems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.",
