            "description": "An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. Attacker-supplied input is not validated/sanitized before being rendered in both the Teacher and Student Console applications, enabling an attacker to execute JavaScript in these applications. Due to the rich and highly privileged functionality offered by the Teacher Console, the ability to silently exploit Cross Site Scripting (XSS) on the Teacher Machine enables remote code execution on any connected student machine (and the teacher's machine).",
