            "description": "The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'edit_group' handler in versions up to, and including, 5.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group ownership, to update group options, including the 'associate_role' parameter, which defines the member's role. This issue was partially patched in version 5.5.2 preventing privilege escalation, however, it was fully patched in 5.5.3.",
