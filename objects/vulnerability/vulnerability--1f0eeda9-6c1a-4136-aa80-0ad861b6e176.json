            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms for specific administrative functions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct administrative functions beyond their intended access level. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need Read-Only Administrator credentials.",
