            "description": "The Amministrazione Aperta WordPress plugin through 3.7.3 does not validate the open parameter before using it in an include statement, leading to a Local File Inclusion issue. The original advisory mentions that unauthenticated users can exploit this, however the affected file generates a fatal error when accessed directly and the affected code is not reached. The issue can be exploited via the dashboard when logged in as an admin, or by making a logged in admin open a malicious link",
