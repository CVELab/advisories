In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.",
