            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots\n\n\nWhen exercising uinput interface syzkaller may try setting up device\nwith a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocation\nfailure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure is\nhandled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkaller\nreports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on the\nsystem which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.\n\nFix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily\nbe extended if we see devices that can track more than 100 contacts.",
