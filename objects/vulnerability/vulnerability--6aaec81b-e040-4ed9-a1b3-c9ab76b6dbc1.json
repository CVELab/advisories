The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
