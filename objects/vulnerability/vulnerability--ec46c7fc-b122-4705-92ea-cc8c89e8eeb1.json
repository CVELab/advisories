The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates incoming traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the file and malware inspection policies and send malicious traffic through the affected device.",
