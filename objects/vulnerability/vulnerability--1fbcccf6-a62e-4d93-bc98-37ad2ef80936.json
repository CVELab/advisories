            "description": "The Prime Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the pae_global_block shortcode due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract information from posts that are not public, including drafts, private, password protected, and restricted posts. This applies to posts created with Elementor only.",
