            "description": "** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in Zend Server 5.6.0 SP4, when installed in the top-level C:\\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework\\bin directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the \"IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules\" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the choice of C:\\ (and the resulting unsafe PATH) is established by an administrative action that is not a default part of the Zend Server installation.",
