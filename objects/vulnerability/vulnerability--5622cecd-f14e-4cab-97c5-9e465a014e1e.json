The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for the creation of scheduled meeting templates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to create a scheduled meeting template. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create a scheduled meeting template that would belong to a user other than themselves.",
