            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/mempolicy: fix mpol_new leak in shared_policy_replace\n\nIf mpol_new is allocated but not used in restart loop, mpol_new will be\nfreed via mpol_put before returning to the caller.  But refcnt is not\ninitialized yet, so mpol_put could not do the right things and might\nleak the unused mpol_new.  This would happen if mempolicy was updated on\nthe shared shmem file while the sp->lock has been dropped during the\nmemory allocation.\n\nThis issue could be triggered easily with the below code snippet if\nthere are many processes doing the below work at the same time:\n\n  shmid = shmget((key_t)5566, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, 0666|IPC_CREAT);\n  shm = shmat(shmid, 0, 0);\n  loop many times {\n    mbind(shm, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_LOCAL, mask, maxnode, 0);\n    mbind(shm + 128 * PAGE_SIZE, 128 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_DEFAULT, mask,\n          maxnode, 0);\n  }",
