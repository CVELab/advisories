If another CPU is\nconcurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it\nmay perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an\nuninitialised index.\n\nThis has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:\n\n | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n |\n | Call trace:\n |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c\n |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378\n |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28\n |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c\n |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24\n |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238\n |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310\n\nMove the initialisation of 'vb->cpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the\naddition to the xarray.",
