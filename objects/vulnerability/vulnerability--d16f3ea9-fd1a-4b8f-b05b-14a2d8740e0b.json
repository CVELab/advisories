A specially \ncrafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single \nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling when behind a reverse proxy.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.\n\n",
