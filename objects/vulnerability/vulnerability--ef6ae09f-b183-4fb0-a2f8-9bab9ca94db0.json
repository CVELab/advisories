            "description": "In the onQueueFilled function of SoftAVCDec, there is a possible out-of-bounds write due to a use after free if a bad header causes the decoder to get caught in a loop while another thread frees the memory it's accessing. This could lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
