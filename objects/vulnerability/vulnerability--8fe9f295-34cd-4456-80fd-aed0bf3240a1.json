            "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS in the Linux Kernel. After CIFS transfers response data to a system call, there are still local variable points to the memory region, and if the system call frees it faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS will access a free memory region, leading to a denial of service.",
