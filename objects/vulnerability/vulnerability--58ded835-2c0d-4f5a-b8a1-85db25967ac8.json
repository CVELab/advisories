In case their XML structure contains iframes and script code, that code may get executed when calling the related picture URL or viewing the related person's image within a browser. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
