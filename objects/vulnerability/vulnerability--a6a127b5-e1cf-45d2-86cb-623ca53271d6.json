            "description": "Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version 0.0.33, a Minder user can use the endpoints `GetRepositoryByName`, `DeleteRepositoryByName`, and `GetArtifactByName` to access any repository in the database, irrespective of who owns the repo and any permissions present. The database query checks by repo owner, repo name and provider name (which is always `github`). These query values are not distinct for the particular user - as long as the user has valid credentials and a provider, they can set the repo owner/name to any value they want and the server will return information on this repo. Version 0.0.33 contains a patch for this issue.",
