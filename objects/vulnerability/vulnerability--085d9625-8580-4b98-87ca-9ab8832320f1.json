However, the topology might\nnot create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps. And it\nwill cause NULL pointer deference.\nCheck that the DAI widget associated with the CPU DAI is valid to prevent\nNULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies with\naggregated amps.",
