            "description": "** DISPUTED ** Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 has a weak default password for the secure vault, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism by leveraging knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number. NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password change is optional to meet different customers' needs.",
