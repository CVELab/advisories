A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If a browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
