            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: seeq: Fix use after free vulnerability in ether3 Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the ether3_probe function, a timer is initialized with a callback\nfunction ether3_ledoff, bound to &prev(dev)->timer. Once the timer is\nstarted, there is a risk of a race condition if the module or device\nis removed, triggering the ether3_remove function to perform cleanup.\nThe sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                    CPU1\n\n                      |  ether3_ledoff\nether3_remove         |\n  free_netdev(dev);   |\n  put_devic           |\n  kfree(dev);         |\n |  ether3_outw(priv(dev)->regs.config2 |= CFG2_CTRLO, REG_CONFIG2);\n                      | // use dev\n\nFix it by ensuring that the timer is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in ether3_remove.",
