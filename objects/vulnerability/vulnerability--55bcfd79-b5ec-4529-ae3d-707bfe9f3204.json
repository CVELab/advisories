            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data\n\nAs seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl\nimplementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting used\nas input for driver ioctl handlers.\n\nThe reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related\nbugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need\nto check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it\nmight still cause an information leak.\n\nTo be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer before\ncalling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initialize\nthem.",
