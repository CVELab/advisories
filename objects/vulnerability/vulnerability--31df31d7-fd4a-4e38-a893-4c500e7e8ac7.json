Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted `Host` header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.",
