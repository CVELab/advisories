            "description": "Huawei smartphones Mate10 with versions earlier before ALP-AL00B 8.0.0.110(C00) have a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass vulnerability. The system does not sufficiently verify the permission, an attacker uses a data cable to connect the smartphone to the computer and then perform some specific operations. Successful exploit could allow the attacker bypass the FRP protection to access the system setting page.",
