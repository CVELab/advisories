            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpi3mr: Synchronous access b/w reset and tm thread for reply queue\n\nWhen the task management thread processes reply queues while the reset\nthread resets them, the task management thread accesses an invalid queue ID\n(0xFFFF), set by the reset thread, which points to unallocated memory,\ncausing a crash.\n\nAdd flag 'io_admin_reset_sync' to synchronize access between the reset,\nI/O, and admin threads. Before a reset, the reset handler sets this flag to\nblock I/O and admin processing threads. If any thread bypasses the initial\ncheck, the reset thread waits up to 10 seconds for processing to finish. If\nthe wait exceeds 10 seconds, the controller is marked as unrecoverable.",
