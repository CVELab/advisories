            "description": "Webswing before 22.1.3 allows X-Forwarded-For header injection. The client IP address is associated with a variable in the configuration page. The {clientIp} variable can be used as an application startup argument. The X-Forwarded-For header can be manipulated by a client to store an arbitrary value that is used to replace the clientIp variable (without sanitization). A client can thus inject multiple arguments into the session startup. Systems that do not use the clientIP variable in the configuration are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in these versions: 20.1.16, 20.2.19, 21.1.8, 21.2.12, and 22.1.3.",
