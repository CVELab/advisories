            "description": "Huawei smart phones P10 Plus with versions earlier than 9.1.0.201(C01E75R1P12T8), earlier than 9.1.0.252(C185E2R1P9T8), earlier than 9.1.0.252(C432E4R1P9T8), and earlier than 9.1.0.255(C576E6R1P8T8) have a digital balance bypass vulnerability. When re-configuring the mobile phone at the digital balance mode, an attacker can perform some operations to bypass the startup wizard, and then open some switch. As a result, the digital balance function is bypassed.",
