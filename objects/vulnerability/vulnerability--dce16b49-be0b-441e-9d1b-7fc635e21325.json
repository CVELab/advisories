            "description": "ETINET BACKBOX E4.09 and H4.09 mismanages password access control. When a user uses the User ID of the process running BBSV to login to the Backbox UI application, the system procedure (USER_AUTHENTICATE_) used for verifying the Password returns 0 (no error). The reason is that the user is not running the XYGate application. Hence, BBSV assumes the Password is correct. For H4.09, the affected version isT0954V04^AAO. For E4.09, the affected version is 22SEP2020.",
