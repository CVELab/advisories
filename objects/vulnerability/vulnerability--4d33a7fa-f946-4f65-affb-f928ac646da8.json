            "description": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions that allow a sensitive configuration detail to be disclosed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving data through SNMP read-only community access. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view Service Set Identifier (SSID) preshared keys (PSKs) that are configured on the affected device.",
