            "description": "Silverstripe Framework is the framework that forms the base of the Silverstripe content management system. Prior to versions 4.13.39 and 5.1.11, if a user should not be able to see a record, but that record can be added to a `GridField` using the `GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter` component, the record's title can be accessed by that user. Versions 4.13.39 and 5.1.11 contain a fix for this issue.",
