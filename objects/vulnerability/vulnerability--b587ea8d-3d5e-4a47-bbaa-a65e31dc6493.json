The vulnerability is a result of untrusted input that is used to calculate an array index; the calculation occurs in the image conversion module, when processing GIF files. The vulnerability leads to an operation that can write to a memory location that is outside of the memory addresses allocated for the data structure. The specific scenario leads to a write access to a memory location that does not belong to the relevant process address space.",
