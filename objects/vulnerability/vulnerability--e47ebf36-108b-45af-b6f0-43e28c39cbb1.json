            "description": "Rockwell Automation RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4, CPR9-SR5, CPR9-SR5.1, and CPR9-SR6 does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the “Total Record Size” field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the “Record Data Size” field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the “Total Record Size” that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
