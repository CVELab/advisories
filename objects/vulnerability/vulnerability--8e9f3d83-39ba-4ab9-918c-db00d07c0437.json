            "description": "Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 22.2.7 and 23.0.4, missing input-size validation of new session names allows users to create app passwords with long names. These long names are then loaded into memory on usage, resulting in impacted performance. Versions 22.2.7 and 23.0.4 contain a fix for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds available.",
