            "description": "The JetBackup â€“ WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.3.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the vulnerable site's server via a forged request, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
