            "description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the mdnscap binary of the CUJO Smart Firewall running firmware 7003. When parsing labels in mDNS packets, the firewall unsafely handles label compression pointers, leading to an uncontrolled recursion that eventually exhausts the stack, crashing the mdnscap process. An unauthenticated attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.",
