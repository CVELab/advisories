            "description": "TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide cross-site-scripting-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.",
