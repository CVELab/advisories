            "description": "A weak malicious user can escalate its privilege whenever CatalystProductionSuite.2019.1.exe (version 1.1.0.21) and CatalystBrowseSuite.2019.1.exe (version 1.1.0.21) installers run. The vulnerability is in the form of DLL Hijacking. The installers try to load DLLs that donâ€™t exist from its current directory; by doing so, an attacker can quickly escalate its privileges.",
