            "description": "The Top 10 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.10.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the tptn_export_tables() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an export of the top 10 table via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
