            "description": "An Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated networked attacker to cause an rdp crash and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf a BGP update message is received over an established BGP session where a BGP SR-TE policy tunnel attribute is malformed and BGP update tracing flag is enabled, the rpd will core. This issue can happen with any BGP session as long as the previous conditions are met. This issue can not propagate as the crash occurs as soon as the malformed update is received.\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 20.4R1.",
