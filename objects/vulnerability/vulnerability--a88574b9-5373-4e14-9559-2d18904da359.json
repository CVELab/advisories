            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17 and earlier and 6 Update 43 and earlier; and OpenJDK 6 and 7; allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Libraries.  NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to improper method-invocation restrictions by the MethodUtil trampoline class, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Java sandbox.",
