            "description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in the Qualcomm IPC router protocol in the Linux kernel. A missing sanity check allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
