            "description": "A vulnerability in the cluster management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information on an affected system. To be affected by this vulnerability, the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software must be in cluster mode. This vulnerability is due to the absence of authentication for sensitive information in the cluster management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the cluster management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to allow the attacker to view sensitive information on the affected system.",
