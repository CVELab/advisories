            "description": "The Live Auction Cockpit in SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) uses a deprecated java applet component within the affected SRM packages which allows an unauthenticated attacker to craft a malicious link, which when clicked by a victim, redirects the browser to a malicious site. On successful exploitation, the attacker could cause low impact on confidentiality and integrity with no impact on the availability of the application.",
