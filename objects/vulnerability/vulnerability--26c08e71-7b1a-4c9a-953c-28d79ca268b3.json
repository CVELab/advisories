            "description": "Stellar-core is a reference implementation for the peer-to-peer agent that manages the Stellar network. Prior to 20.4.0, core nodes could be randomly crashed due to a race condition with a 3rd party library. The likelihood of affecting the network is low since crashed nodes come back up online right away. Code fix mitigation is part of Stellar-core v20.4.0 release",
