This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases. A site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met: The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH or POST requests, or the site has another web services module enabled, like JSON:API in Drupal 8, or Services or RESTful Web Services in Drupal 7. (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use.)",
