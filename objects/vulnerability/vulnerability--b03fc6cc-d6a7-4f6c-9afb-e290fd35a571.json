Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
