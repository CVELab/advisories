            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range() when used for zapping normal PMDs\n\nOn the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for zapping normal\nPMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE\nentries in the pointed-to page table:\n\n    collapse_pte_mapped_thp\n      pmdp_collapse_flush\n        flush_tlb_range\n\nThe arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can\nbe used for page table removal, and does not use any last-level\ninvalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by making it behave the\nsame way.\n\nCurrently, X86 only uses this information for the following two purposes,\nwhich I think means the issue doesn't have much impact:\n\n - In native_flush_tlb_multi() for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be\n   IPI'd to avoid issues with speculative page table walks.\n - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.\n\nThe patch \"x86/mm: only invalidate final translations with INVLPGB\" which\nis currently under review (see\n<https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241230175550.4046587-13-riel@surriel.com/>)\nwould probably be making the impact of this a lot worse.",
