            "description": "The Login/Signup Popup, Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ), and Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax) WordPress plugins by XootiX are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery via the save_settings function found in the ~/includes/xoo-framework/admin/class-xoo-admin-settings.php file which makes it possible for attackers to update arbitrary options on a site that can be used to create an administrative user account and grant full privileged access to a compromised site. This affects versions <= 2.2 in Login/Signup Popup, versions <= 2.5.1 in Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ), and versions <= 2.0 in Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax).",
