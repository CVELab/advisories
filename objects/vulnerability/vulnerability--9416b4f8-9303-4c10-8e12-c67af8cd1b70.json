This allows an attacker to trigger an e-mail change for a user logged into a cloud foundry instance via a malicious link on a attacker controlled site. This vulnerability is applicable only when using the UAA internal user store for authentication. Deployments enabled for integration via SAML or LDAP are not affected.",
