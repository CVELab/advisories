            "description": "The PSW Front-end Login & Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.12 via the customer_registration() function. This is due to the use of a weak, low-entropy OTP mechanism in the forget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user, including administrators, and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.",
