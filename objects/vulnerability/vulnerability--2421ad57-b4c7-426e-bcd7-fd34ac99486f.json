            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/arm-smmu: Fix arm_smmu_device refcount leak when arm_smmu_rpm_get fails\n\narm_smmu_rpm_get() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(), which increases the\nrefcount of the \"smmu\" even though the return value is less than 0.\n\nThe reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths of\narm_smmu_rpm_get() in its caller functions. When arm_smmu_rpm_get()\nfails, the caller functions forget to decrease the refcount of \"smmu\"\nincreased by arm_smmu_rpm_get(), causing a refcount leak.\n\nFix this issue by calling pm_runtime_resume_and_get() instead of\npm_runtime_get_sync() in arm_smmu_rpm_get(), which can keep the refcount\nbalanced in case of failure.",
