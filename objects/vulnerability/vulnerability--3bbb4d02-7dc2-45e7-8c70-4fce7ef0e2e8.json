            "description": "\nSoar Cloud Ltd. HR Portal has a weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password. The reset password link sent out through e-mail, and the link will remain valid after the password has been reset and after the expected expiration date. An attacker with access to the browser history or has the line can thus use the URL again to change the password in order to take over the account.\n\n\n\n",
