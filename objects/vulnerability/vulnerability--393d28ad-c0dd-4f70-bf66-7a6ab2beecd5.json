The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of confidential information on an affected device. An attacker at any privilege level could exploit this vulnerability by accessing local filesystems and extracting sensitive information from them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive data, which they could use to elevate their privilege.",
