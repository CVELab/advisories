            "description": "The Happy Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via DOM in all versions up to and including 3.9.1.1 (versions up to 2.9.1.1 in Happy Addons for Elementor Pro) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
