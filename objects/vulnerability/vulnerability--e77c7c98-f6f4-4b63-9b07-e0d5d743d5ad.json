            "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Veritas NetBackup Snapshot Manager before 10.2.0.1 that allowed untrusted clients to interact with the RabbitMQ service. This was caused by improper validation of the client certificate due to misconfiguration of the RabbitMQ service. Exploiting this impacts the confidentiality and integrity of messages controlling the backup and restore jobs, and could result in the service becoming unavailable. This impacts only the jobs controlling the backup and restore activities, and does not allow access to (or deletion of) the backup snapshot data itself. This vulnerability is confined to the NetBackup Snapshot Manager feature and does not impact the RabbitMQ instance on the NetBackup primary servers.",
