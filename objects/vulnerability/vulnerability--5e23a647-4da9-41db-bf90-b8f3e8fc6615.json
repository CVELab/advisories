            "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication function of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully log in to an affected device using two distinct usernames. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur when certain sequences of actions are processed during an SSH login event on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating an SSH session to the device with a specific sequence that presents the two usernames. A successful exploit could result in logging data misrepresentation, user enumeration, or, in certain circumstances, a command authorization bypass. See the Details section for more information.",
