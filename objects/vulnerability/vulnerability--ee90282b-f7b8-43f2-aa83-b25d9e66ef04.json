            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: appletouch - initialize work before device registration\n\nSyzbot has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by\nwork->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.\n\nThis may happen, since input_dev->close() calls\ncancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_\ninput_register_device() call.\n\nSo this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input\ndevice",
