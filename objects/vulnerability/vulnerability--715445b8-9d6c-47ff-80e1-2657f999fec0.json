            "description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP update message is received over an established BGP session, and that message contains a specific, optional transitive attribute, this session will be torn down with an update message error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected system as the processing error occurs as soon as the update is received. This issue is exploitable remotely as the respective attribute can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate AS (if any). Continuous receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Some customers have experienced these BGP session flaps which prompted Juniper SIRT to release this advisory out of cycle before fixed releases are widely available as there is an effective workaround. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1R1 and later versions prior to 20.4R3-S8; 21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S6; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.3 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3; 23.1 versions prior to 23.1R1-S1, 23.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8-EVO; 21.1 version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S6-EVO; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2-EVO; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO; 23.1 versions prior to 23.1R1-S1-EVO, 23.1R2-EVO.",
