            "description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.",
