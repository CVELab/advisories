The vulnerability is due to the improper detection of content within executable (EXE) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized EXE file that is not recognized and blocked by the ESA. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to send email messages that contain malicious executable files to unsuspecting users. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh03786.",
