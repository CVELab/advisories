Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the HTTP service listening on TCP port 80. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain access to critical functions on the device.
