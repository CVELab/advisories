            "description": "An unauthenticated network-based attacker able to send a maliciously crafted LLDP packet to the local segment, through a local segment broadcast, may be able to cause a Junos device to enter an improper boundary check condition allowing a memory corruption to occur, leading to a denial of service. Further crafted packets may be able to sustain the denial of service condition. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) Further, if the attacker is authenticated on the target device receiving and processing the malicious LLDP packet, while receiving the crafted packets, the attacker may be able to perform command or arbitrary code injection over the target device thereby elevating their permissions and privileges, and taking control of the device. Score: 7.8 HIGH (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) An unauthenticated network-based attacker able to send a maliciously crafted LLDP packet to one or more local segments, via LLDP proxy / tunneling agents or other LLDP through Layer 3 deployments, through one or more local segment broadcasts, may be able to cause multiple Junos devices to enter an improper boundary check condition allowing a memory corruption to occur, leading to multiple distributed Denials of Services. These Denials of Services attacks may have cascading Denials of Services to adjacent connected devices, impacts network devices, servers, workstations, etc. Further crafted packets may be able to sustain these Denials of Services conditions. Score 6.8 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) Further, if the attacker is authenticated on one or more target devices receiving and processing these malicious LLDP packets, while receiving the crafted packets, the attacker may be able to perform command or arbitrary code injection over multiple target devices thereby elevating their permissions and privileges, and taking control multiple devices. Score: 7.8 HIGH (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D71; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S7; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D55; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R8-S5, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D46, 14.1X53-D50, 14.1X53-D107; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R7-S9, 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F2-S17, 15.1F5-S8, 15.1F6-S8, 15.1R5-S7, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D90; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D65; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R4-S6, 16.1R5; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D45; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2.
