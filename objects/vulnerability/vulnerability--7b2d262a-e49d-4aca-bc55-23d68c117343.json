            "description": "A flaw in libtasn1 causes inefficient handling of specific certificate data. When processing a large number of elements in a certificate, libtasn1 takes much longer than expected, which can slow down or even crash the system. This flaw allows an attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing a denial of service attack.",
