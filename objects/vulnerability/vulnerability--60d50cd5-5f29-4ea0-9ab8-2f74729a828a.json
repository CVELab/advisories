            "description": "The Elementor Website Builder â€“ More than Just a Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the url parameter of multiple widgets in all versions up to, and including, 3.23.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in Elementor Editor pages. This was partially patched in version 3.23.2.",
