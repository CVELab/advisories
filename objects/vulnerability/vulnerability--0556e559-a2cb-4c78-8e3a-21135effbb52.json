            "description": "A vulnerability in the PROFINET handler for Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) messages of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a crash on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of LLDP messages in the PROFINET LLDP message handler. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious LLDP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.",
