            "description": "** DISPUTED **  The Apache HTTP Server, when accessed through a TCP connection with a large window size, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network bandwidth consumption) via a Range header that specifies multiple copies of the same fragment.  NOTE: the severity of this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that the large window size required by the attack is not normally supported or configured by the server, or that a DDoS-style attack would accomplish the same goal.",
