            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Check sb_bsize_shift after reading superblock\n\nFuzzers like to scribble over sb_bsize_shift but in reality it's very\nunlikely that this field would be corrupted on its own. Nevertheless it\nshould be checked to avoid the possibility of messy mount errors due to\nbad calculations. It's always a fixed value based on the block size so\nwe can just check that it's the expected value.\n\nTested with:\n\n    mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock /dev/vdb\n    for i in 0 -1 64 65 32 33; do\n        gfs2_edit -p sb field sb_bsize_shift $i /dev/vdb\n        mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test && umount /mnt/test\n    done\n\nBefore this patch we get a withdraw after\n\n[   76.413681] gfs2: fsid=loop0.0: fatal: invalid metadata block\n[   76.413681]   bh = 19 (type: exp=5, found=4)\n[   76.413681]   function = gfs2_meta_buffer, file = fs/gfs2/meta_io.c, line = 492\n\nand with UBSAN configured we also get complaints like\n\n[   76.373395] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/gfs2/ops_fstype.c:295:19\n[   76.373815] shift exponent 4294967287 is too large for 64-bit type 'long unsigned int'\n\nAfter the patch, these complaints don't appear, mount fails immediately\nand we get an explanation in dmesg.",
