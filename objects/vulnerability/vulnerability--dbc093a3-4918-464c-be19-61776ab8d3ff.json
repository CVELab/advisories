If the function exits early\ndue to an error, the memory is unmapped. If the function completes\nsuccessfully, the memory remains mapped.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c:4337 amdgpu_device_init() warn: 'adev->rmmio' from ioremap() not released on lines: 4035,4045,4051,4058,4068,4337",
