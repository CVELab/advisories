            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper user permissions that are configured by default on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.",
