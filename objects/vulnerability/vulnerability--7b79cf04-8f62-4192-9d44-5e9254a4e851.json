            "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of a protocol in Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISR G2) Routers running Cisco IOS 15.0 through 15.6 could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a misclassification of Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Ethernet frame to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc03809.",
