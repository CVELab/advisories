The password authentication for unlocking can be bypassed by forcing the authentication result to be true through runtime manipulation. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary password. NOTE: the vendor has indicated that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes jailbroken devices.",
