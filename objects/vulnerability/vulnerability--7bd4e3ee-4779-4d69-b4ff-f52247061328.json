            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf,perf: Fix invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_prog\n\nSyzbot reported [1] crash that happens for following tracing scenario:\n\n  - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach it to the\n    process and set bpf program to it\n  - attached process forks -> chid creates inherited event\n\n    the new child event shares the parent's bpf program and tp_event\n    (hence prog_array) which is global for tracepoint\n\n  - exit both process and its child -> release both events\n  - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array\n    and second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because\n    tp_event->prog_array is NULL\n\nThe fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_array\nis valid before it tries to remove the bpf program from it.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/Z1MR6dCIKajNS6nU@krava/T/#m91dbf0688221ec7a7fc95e896a7ef9ff93b0b8ad",
