The vulnerability is due to the lack of authorization controls in the web application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to add user accounts to the configuration of an affected device. These accounts would not be administrator or operator accounts.",
