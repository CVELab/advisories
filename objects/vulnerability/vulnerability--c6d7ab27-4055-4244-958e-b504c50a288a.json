            "description": "An exploitable buffer overflow exists in the Joyent SmartOS 20161110T013148Z Hyprlofs file system. The vulnerability is present in the Ioctl system call with the command HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES when dealing with 32-bit file systems. An attacker can craft an input that can cause a buffer overflow in the nm variable leading to an out of bounds memory access and could result in potential privilege escalation. This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2016-9032.",
