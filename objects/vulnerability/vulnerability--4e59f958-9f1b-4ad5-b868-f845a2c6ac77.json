            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: fix dangling sco_conn and use-after-free in sco_sock_timeout\n\nConnecting the same socket twice consecutively in sco_sock_connect()\ncould lead to a race condition where two sco_conn objects are created\nbut only one is associated with the socket. If the socket is closed\nbefore the SCO connection is established, the timer associated with the\ndangling sco_conn object won't be canceled. As the sock object is being\nfreed, the use-after-free problem happens when the timer callback\nfunction sco_sock_timeout() accesses the socket. Here's the call trace:\n\ndump_stack+0x107/0x163\n? refcount_inc+0x1c/\nprint_address_description.constprop.0+0x1c/0x47e\n? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b\nkasan_report+0x13a/0x173\n? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b\ncheck_memory_region+0x132/0x139\nrefcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b\nsco_sock_timeout+0xb2/0x1ba\nprocess_one_work+0x739/0xbd1\n? cancel_delayed_work+0x13f/0x13f\n? __raw_spin_lock_init+0xf0/0xf0\n? to_kthread+0x59/0x85\nworker_thread+0x593/0x70e\nkthread+0x346/0x35a\n? drain_workqueue+0x31a/0x31a\n? kthread_bind+0x4b/0x4b\nret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30",
