            "description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because requests that are sent to the API are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all participants on a call to be disconnected, resulting in a DoS condition.",
