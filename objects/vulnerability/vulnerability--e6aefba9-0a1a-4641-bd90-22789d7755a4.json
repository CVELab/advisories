            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) Software and Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (SME) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.",
