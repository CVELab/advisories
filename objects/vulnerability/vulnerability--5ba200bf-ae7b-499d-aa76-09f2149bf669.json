            "description": "Swisscom MySwisscomAssistant 2.17.1.1065 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. This vulnerability exists due to the way .dll files are loaded. It allows an attacker to load a .dll of the attacker's choosing that could execute arbitrary code without the user's knowledge. The specific flaw exists within the handling of several DLLs (dwmapi.dll, IPHLPAPI.DLL, WindowsCodecs.dll, RpcRtRemote.dll, CRYPTSP.dll, rasadhlp.dll, DNSAPI.dll, ntmarta.dll, netbios.dll, olepro32.dll, security.dll, winhttp.dll, WINSTA.dll) loaded by the MySwisscomAssistant_Setup.exe process.",
