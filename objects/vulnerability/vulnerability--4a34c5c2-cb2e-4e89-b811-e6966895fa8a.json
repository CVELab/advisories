            "description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco SD-WAN Solution vManage software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web UI improperly validates SQL values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on, or return values from, the underlying database as well as the operating system.",
