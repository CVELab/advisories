            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()\n\nsyzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),\nfor one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fix\nthis warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,\nfor practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the\n\"too small to fail\" memory-allocation rule applies.\n\nOne might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such\nrequest will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately\nreturning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.\nThere is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.",
