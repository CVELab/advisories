The vulnerability is due to insecure key generation during application configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a known insecure key value to bypass security protections by sending arbitrary requests using the insecure key to a targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager releases prior to 11.5(2). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuv67964.",
