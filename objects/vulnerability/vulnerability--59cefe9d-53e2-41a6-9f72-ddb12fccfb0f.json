            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nacpi: nfit: fix narrowing conversion in acpi_nfit_ctl\n\nSyzkaller has reported a warning in to_nfit_bus_uuid(): \"only secondary\nbus families can be translated\". This warning is emited if the argument\nis equal to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_NFIT == 0. Function acpi_nfit_ctl() first\nverifies that a user-provided value call_pkg->nd_family of type u64 is\nnot equal to 0. Then the value is converted to int, and only after that\nis compared to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_MAX. This can lead to passing an invalid\nargument to acpi_nfit_ctl(), if call_pkg->nd_family is non-zero, while\nthe lower 32 bits are zero.\n\nFurthermore, it is best to return EINVAL immediately upon seeing the\ninvalid user input.  The WARNING is insufficient to prevent further\nundefined behavior based on other invalid user input.\n\nAll checks of the input value should be applied to the original variable\ncall_pkg->nd_family.\n\n[iweiny: update commit message]",
