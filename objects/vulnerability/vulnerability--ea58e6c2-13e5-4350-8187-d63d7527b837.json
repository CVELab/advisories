This file crafts a SQL statement to identify the database that is to be in use with the current user's session. The database variable can be populated from the URL, and when supplied non-expected characters, can be manipulated to obtain access to the underlying database. The /CRM/CustomPages/ACCPAC/AP_DocumentUI.asp?SID=<VALID-SID>&database=1';WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'-- URI is a Proof of Concept.",
