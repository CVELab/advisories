            "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows Deployment Services TFTP Server handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions on a target system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could create a specially crafted request, causing Windows to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Deployment Services TFTP Server handles objects in memory, aka 'Windows Deployment Services TFTP Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'.",
