            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nath11k: Change max no of active probe SSID and BSSID to fw capability\n\nThe maximum number of SSIDs in a for active probe requests is currently\nreported as 16 (WLAN_SCAN_PARAMS_MAX_SSID) when registering the driver.\nThe scan_req_params structure only has the capacity to hold 10 SSIDs.\nThis leads to a buffer overflow which can be triggered from\nwpa_supplicant in userspace. When copying the SSIDs into the\nscan_req_params structure in the ath11k_mac_op_hw_scan route, it can\noverwrite the extraie pointer.\n\nFirmware supports 16 ssid * 4 bssid, for each ssid 4 bssid combo probe\nrequest will be sent, so totally 64 probe requests supported. So\nset both max ssid and bssid to 16 and 4 respectively. Remove the\nredundant macros of ssid and bssid.\n\nTested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01300-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
