Affected devices contain hardcoded credentials for remote access to the device operating system with root privileges. This could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to gain full access to a device, if they are in possession of these credentials and if the ssh service is enabled (e.g., by exploitation of CVE-2024-41793).",
