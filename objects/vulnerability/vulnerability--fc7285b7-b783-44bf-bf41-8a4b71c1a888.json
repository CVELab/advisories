The component is: htdocs/fileaccess.cgi. The attack vector is: A crafted HTTP request handled by fileacces.cgi could allow an attacker to mount a ROP attack: if the HTTP header field CONTENT_TYPE starts with ''boundary=' followed by more than 256 characters, a buffer overflow would be triggered, potentially causing code execution.",
