            "description": "A vulnerability in chat messaging features of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to chat entry points. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a messaging chat entry point in the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. The application may not recover on its own and may need an administrator to manually restart services to recover.",
