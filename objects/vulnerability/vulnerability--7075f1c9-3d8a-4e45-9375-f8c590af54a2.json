            "description": "Trend Micro ServerProtect 5.58, and possibly InterScan Messaging Security Suite and InterScan Web Security Suite, have a default configuration setting of \"Do not scan compressed files when Extracted file count exceeds 500 files,\" which may be too low in certain circumstances, which allows remote attackers to bypass anti-virus checks by sending compressed archives containing many small files. NOTE: since this is related to a configuration setting that has an operational impact that might vary depending on the environment, and the product is claimed to report a message when the compressed file exceeds specified limits, perhaps this should not be included in CVE.",
