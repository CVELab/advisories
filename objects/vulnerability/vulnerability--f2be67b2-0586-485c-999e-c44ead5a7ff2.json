            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, and 1.4.2_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that this allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing the defaultReadObject method in the Serialization API to set a volatile field multiple times.",
