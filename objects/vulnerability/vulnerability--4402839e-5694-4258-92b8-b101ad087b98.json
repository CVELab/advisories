The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) program of INSPUR server is weak in checking the firmware and lacks the signature verification mechanism, the attacker who obtains the administrator's rights can control the BMC by inserting malicious code into the firmware program and bypassing the current verification mechanism to upgrade the BMC.",
