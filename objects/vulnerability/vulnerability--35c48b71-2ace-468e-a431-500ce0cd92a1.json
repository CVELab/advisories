            "description": "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nSolr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the \"configset upload\" API.  Commonly known as a \"zipslip\", maliciously constructed ZIP files can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem.  \nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue.  Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solr's \"Rule-Based Authentication Plugin\" to restrict access to the configset upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users.",
