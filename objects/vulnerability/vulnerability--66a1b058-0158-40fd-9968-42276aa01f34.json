            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG\n\nWhen BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls\n__bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them\nthe struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.\n\nThe trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit\ninstructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but\nemit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space\nand uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using\nkzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the\ntrampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()\ncausing a kernel crash.\n\nFix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()\nas it can work with addresses that are greater than 48-bits.",
