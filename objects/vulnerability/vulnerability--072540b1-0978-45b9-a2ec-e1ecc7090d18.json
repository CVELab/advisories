            "description": "A vulnerability in the processing of TCP MD5 authentication in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a BGP or LDP session configured with MD5 authentication to succeed, even if the peer does not have TCP MD5 authentication enabled. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO.
