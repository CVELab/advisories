            "description": "@fastly/js-compute is a JavaScript SDK and runtime for building Fastly Compute applications. The implementation of several functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug. This bug could allow for unintended data loss if the result of the preceding functions were sent anywhere else, and often results in a guest trap causing services to return a 500. This bug has been fixed in version 3.16.0 of the `@fastly/js-compute` package.",
