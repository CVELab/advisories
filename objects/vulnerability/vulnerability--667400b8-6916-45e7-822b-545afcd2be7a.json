The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of fields in CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb95842.",
