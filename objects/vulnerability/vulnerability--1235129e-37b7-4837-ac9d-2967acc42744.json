            "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Firepower Chassis Manager (FCM) of Cisco FXOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the FCM interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests that could take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.",
