The DNS domain name record decompression functionality in pico_dns_decompress_name() in pico_dns_common.c does not validate the compression pointer offset values with respect to the actual data present in a DNS response packet, causing out-of-bounds writes that lead to Denial-of-Service and Remote Code Execution.",
