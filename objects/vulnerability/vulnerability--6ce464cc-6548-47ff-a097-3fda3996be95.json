            "description": "The vulnerability was found in OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6.3 and 2.5.6. This issue occurs due to improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy, particularly the x-forwarded-for header. This lack of sanitization can allow attackers to inject malicious payloads into service mesh logs, leading to log injection and spoofing attacks. Such injections can mislead logging mechanisms, enabling attackers to manipulate log entries or execute reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
