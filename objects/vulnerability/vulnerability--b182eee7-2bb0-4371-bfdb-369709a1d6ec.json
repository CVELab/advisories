The Systeam application is an ERP system that uses a mixed architecture based on SaaS tenant and user management, and on-premise database and web application counterparts. This issue occurs during the password recovery procedure for a given user, where a difference in messages could allow an attacker to determine if the given user is valid or not, enabling a brute force attack with valid users.",
