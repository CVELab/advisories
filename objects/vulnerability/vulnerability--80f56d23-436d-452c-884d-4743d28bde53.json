            "description": "The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clear_uucss_logs function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear plugin logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
