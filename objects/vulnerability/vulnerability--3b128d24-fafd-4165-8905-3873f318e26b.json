            "description": "The CRM WordPress Plugin â€“ RepairBuddy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.8120. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their email through the wc_update_user_data AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.",
