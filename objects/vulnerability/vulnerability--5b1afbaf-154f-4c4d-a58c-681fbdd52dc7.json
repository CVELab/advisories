            "description": "Telegram Desktop through 2.4.3 does not require passcode entry upon pushing the Export key within the Export Telegram Data wizard. The threat model is a victim who has voluntarily opened Export Wizard but is then distracted. An attacker then approaches the unattended desktop and pushes the Export key.
