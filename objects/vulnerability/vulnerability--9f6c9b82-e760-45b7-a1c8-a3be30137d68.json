            "description": "The Biagiotti Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators, granted they have access to an email.",
