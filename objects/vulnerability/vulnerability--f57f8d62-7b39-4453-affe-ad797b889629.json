The web server of affected devices fails to properly sanitize user input for the /sicweb-ajax/tmproot/ endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis could allow an authenticated remote attacker to traverse directories on the system and download arbitrary files. By exploring active session IDs, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to escalate privileges to the administrator role.",
