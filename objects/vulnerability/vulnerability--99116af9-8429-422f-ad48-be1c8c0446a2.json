A remote authenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this to store malicious HTML code in a trusted application data store. When victim users access the data store through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application. 6.14 (6.14.0) is also a fixed release.",
