            "description": "When a URL is added to the map element, it is recorded in the database with sequential IDs. Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last sysmapelementurlid value and increments it by one. However, an issue arises when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the map element.",
