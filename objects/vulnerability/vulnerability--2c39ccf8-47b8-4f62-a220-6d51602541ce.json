            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv->pdev before using it\n\npriv->pdev pointer was set after being used in\nfsl_asoc_card_audmux_init().\nMove this assignment at the start of the probe function, so\nsub-functions can correctly use pdev through priv.\n\nfsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv->pdev to get access to the\ndev struct, used with dev_err macros.\nAs priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer dereference.\nNote that if priv->dev is dereferenced before assignment but never used,\nfor example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won't crash\nprobably due to compiler optimisations.",
