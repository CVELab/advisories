            "description": "A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS running on the ACX5448 and ACX710 platforms may cause BFD sessions to flap when a high rate of transit ARP packets are received. This, in turn, may impact routing protocols and network stability, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. When a high rate of transit ARP packets are exceptioned to the CPU and BFD flaps, the following log messages may be seen: bfdd[15864]: BFDD_STATE_UP_TO_DOWN: BFD Session 192.168.14.3 (IFL 232) state Up -> Down LD/RD(17/19) Up time:11:38:17 Local diag: CtlExpire Remote diag: None Reason: Detect Timer Expiry. bfdd[15864]: BFDD_TRAP_SHOP_STATE_DOWN: local discriminator: 17, new state: down, interface: irb.998, peer addr: 192.168.14.3 rpd[15839]: RPD_ISIS_ADJDOWN: IS-IS lost L2 adjacency to peer on irb.998, reason: BFD Session Down bfdd[15864]: BFDD_TRAP_SHOP_STATE_UP: local discriminator: 17, new state: up, interface: irb.998, peer addr: 192.168.14.3 This issue only affects the ACX5448 Series and ACX710 Series routers.
