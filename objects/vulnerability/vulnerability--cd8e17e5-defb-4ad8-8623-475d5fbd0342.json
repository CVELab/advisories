            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2_25, and 1.3.1_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to an \"invalid assignment\" and inconsistent length values in a JPEG image encoder (JPEGImageEncoderImpl).",
