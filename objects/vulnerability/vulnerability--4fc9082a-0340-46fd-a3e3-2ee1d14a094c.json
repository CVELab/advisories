            "description": "Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's \"Navigation-Timing Level 2\" draft specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
