            "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software (prior to Release 11.1) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view any file on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform proper input validation of HTTP requests and fails to apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that uses directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view any file on the system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc99604.",
