            "description": "A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager v1.20. The HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager is an application that is installed in a VMWare or Microsoft Hyper-V environment that is used to setup and configure an HPE Moonshot 1500 chassis. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited by an unauthenticated user to cause a stack based buffer overflow using user supplied input to the `khuploadfile.cgi` CGI ELF. The stack based buffer overflow could lead to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, and/or compromise system integrity. **Note:** HPE recommends that customers discontinue the use of the HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager. The HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager application is discontinued, no longer supported, is not available to download from the HPE Support Center, and no patch is available.",
