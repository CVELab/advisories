            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of TP-Link Archer A7 Firmware Ver: 190726 AC1750 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SSH port forwarding requests during initial setup. The issue results from the lack of proper authentication prior to establishing SSH port forwarding rules. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the WAN interface. Was ZDI-CAN-9664.",
