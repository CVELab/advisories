            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options\n\nThe TCP option parser in mptcp (mptcp_get_options) could read one byte\nout of bounds. When the length is 1, the execution flow gets into the\nloop, reads one byte of the opcode, and if the opcode is neither\nTCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads one more byte, which exceeds the\nlength of 1.\n\nThis fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack\nout of bounds when parsing TCP options.\").",
