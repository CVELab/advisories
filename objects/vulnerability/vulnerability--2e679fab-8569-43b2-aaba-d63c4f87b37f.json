            "description": "Acer Care Center 4.00.30xx before 4.00.3042 contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The user process communicates with a service of system authority called ACCsvc through a named pipe. In this case, the Named Pipe is also given Read and Write rights to the general user. In addition, the service program does not verify the user when communicating. A thread may exist with a specific command. When the path of the program to be executed is sent, there is a local privilege escalation in which the service program executes the path with system privileges.",
