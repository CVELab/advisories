In versions prior to 10.0.0 one can exploit a lack of sanitization on SVG file uploads and inject javascript into their user avatar. As a result any user viewing the avatar will be subject to a cross site scripting attack. Users of GLPI are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disallow SVG avatars.",
