            "description": "An unhandled exception in the danny-avila/librechat repository, version git 600d217, can cause the server to crash, leading to a full denial of service. This issue occurs when certain API endpoints receive malformed input, resulting in an uncaught exception. Although a valid JWT is required to exploit this vulnerability, LibreChat allows open registration, enabling unauthenticated attackers to create an account and perform the attack. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.",
