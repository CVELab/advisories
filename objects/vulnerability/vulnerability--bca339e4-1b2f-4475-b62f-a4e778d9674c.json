            "description": "Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a bypass in the plugin signature verification. An attacker can convince a server admin to download and successfully run a malicious plugin even though unsigned plugins are not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not install plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.",
