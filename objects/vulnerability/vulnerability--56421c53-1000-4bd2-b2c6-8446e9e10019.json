The export component of GetApps(com.xiaomi.mipicks) mishandles the functionality of opening other components. Attackers need to induce users to open specific web pages in a specific network environment. By jumping to the WebView component of Messaging(com.android.MMS) and loading malicious web pages, information leakage can occur. This is fixed on version: 2001122; 11.0.1.54.",
