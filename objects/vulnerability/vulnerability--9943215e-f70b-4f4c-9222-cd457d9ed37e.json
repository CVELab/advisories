            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws\n\nCommit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with\n__counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'\nwith __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number\nof elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of\nbounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be\ninitialized with the number of elements before the first array access\nhappens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the\ninitialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in\nraspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws\nhas been accessed:\n\n  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4\n  index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')\n\nMove the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which\nclears up the warning.",
