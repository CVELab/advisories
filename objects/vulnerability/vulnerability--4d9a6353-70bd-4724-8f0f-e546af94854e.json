            "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Versions prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.4.2 contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability inside component (or block) `Send Web Request`. The root cause is  that IPV6 address is not restricted or filtered, which allows attackers to perform a server side request forgery to visit an IPV6 service. autogpt-platform-beta-v0.4.2 fixes the issue.",
