            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()\n\nThere is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on\ns390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in\ndo_exception().\n\nHowever, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more\ngeneral\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with\nPTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON\notherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().\n\nFix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar\nto x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault\nflags, for easier debugging.\n\nNote that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot\nsupport swap entries on other levels than PTE level.",
