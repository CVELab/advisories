(dot dot) in an application/x-msnmsgrp2p MSN emoticon (aka custom smiley) request, a related issue to CVE-2004-0122.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is resultant from a vulnerability in which an emoticon download request is processed even without a preceding text/x-mms-emoticon message that announced availability of the emoticon.",
