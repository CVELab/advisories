            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation\n\nCalculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value\nbetween the requested size and the actual size does not consider\nthe partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.\n\nFix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the\ntotal size is now deduced from the difference between the end and\nstart addresses.\n\nAdditionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer\nand more understandable form.\n\n[Joonas: Add Requires: tag]\nRequires: 60a2066c5005 (\"drm/i915/gem: Adjust vma offset for framebuffer mmap offset\")\n(cherry picked from commit 97b6784753da06d9d40232328efc5c5367e53417)",
