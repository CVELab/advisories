A malicious user can edit or add the templateName parameter in order to include JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed by a victim's web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. Here, the /aom/html/EditTemplate.jsf and /aom/html/ViewAllTemplatesPage.jsf templateName parameter is used.",
