            "description": "Netgear Nighthawk R6700 version 1.0.4.120 makes use of a hardcoded credential. It does not appear that normal users are intended to be able to manipulate configuration backups due to the fact that they are encrypted/obfuscated. By extracting the configuration using readily available public tools, a user can reconfigure settings not intended to be manipulated, repackage the configuration, and restore a backup causing these settings to be changed.",
