            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init\n\nMove the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event->ctx assignment to\noccur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that\nchild_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within\ninherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the\ncleanup code.\n\nDetails:\n\nThere's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of\nmultiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not\na single regression.\n\nThe code initially incremented refcount then assigned context\nimmediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early\nvalidity check for child_event was added before the\nrefcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was\nadded, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.\nThe problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial\ncheck passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its\nprecondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after\nits initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any\nsubsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nTo resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment\ndirectly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the\nparent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on\nevent->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is\nnon-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing\nin child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.\n\n[ mingo: Expanded the changelog from another email by Gabriel Shahrouzi. ]",
