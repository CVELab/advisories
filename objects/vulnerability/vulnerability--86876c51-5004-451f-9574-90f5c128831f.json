            "description": "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel in Camel-Undertow component under particular conditions.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.3, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.\n\nCamel undertow component is vulnerable to Camel message header injection, in particular the custom header filter strategy used by the component only filter the \"out\" direction, while it doesn't filter the \"in\" direction.\n\n\nThis allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviour such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.",
