            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvideo: fbdev: nvidiafb: Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow\n\nCoverity complains of a possible buffer overflow. However,\ngiven the 'static' scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks\nlike that can't happen after examiniing the call sites.\n\nCID 19036 (#1 of 1): Copy into fixed size buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW)\n1. fixed_size_dest: You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size string\n  chan->adapter.name by copying name without checking the length.\n2. parameter_as_source: Note: This defect has an elevated risk because the\n  source argument is a parameter of the current function.\n 89        strcpy(chan->adapter.name, name);\n\nFix this warning by using strscpy() which will silence the warning and\nprevent any future buffer overflows should the names used to identify the\nchannel become much longer.",
