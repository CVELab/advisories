            "description": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to send data directly to the kernel of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the software improperly filters Ethernet frames sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the Layer 2 (L2) filters and send data directly to the kernel of the affected device. A malicious frame successfully delivered would make the target device generate a specific syslog entry.",
