This would allow an attacker to : - Change the password, resulting in a DOS of the users - Change the streaming source, compromising the integrity of the stream - Change the streaming destination, compromising the confidentiality of the stream This issue affects Yellowbrik: PEC 1864. No patch has been issued by the manufacturer as this model was discontinued.",
