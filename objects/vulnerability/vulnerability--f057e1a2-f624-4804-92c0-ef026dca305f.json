            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought up\n\nSince 8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work when\nresuming after suspend, even when the interface was not previously\nenabled. This causes a null dereference error as the workqueue is only\nallocated and initialized in mcp251x_open().\n\nTo fix this we move the workqueue init to mcp251x_can_probe() as there\nis no reason to do it later and repeat it whenever mcp251x_open() is\ncalled.\n\n[mkl: fix error handling in mcp251x_stop()]",
