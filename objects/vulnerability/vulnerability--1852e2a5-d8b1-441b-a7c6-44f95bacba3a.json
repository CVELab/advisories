            "description": "The Coupon X: Discount Pop Up, Promo Code Pop Ups, Announcement Pop Up, WooCommerce Popups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 via deserialization of untrusted input from post content passed to the capture_email AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
