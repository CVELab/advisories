That should be\nfine as long as the compiler doesn't make up a non existing value for\nthe flags, however KCSAN still complains when the request owner changes\noter flag bits:\n\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in io_req_task_cancel / io_wq_free_work\n...\nread to 0xffff888117207448 of 8 bytes by task 3871 on cpu 0:\n req_ref_put_and_test io_uring/refs.h:22 [inline]\n\nSkip REQ_F_REFCOUNT checks for iowq, we know it's set.",
