            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()\n\nThe function nilfs_btree_check_delete(), which checks whether degeneration\nto direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry, causes memory\naccess outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the\nroot node has no entries.\n\nThis does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes\nare never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.  However, it can happen\nif the b-tree root node read from a device is configured that way, so fix\nthis potential issue by adding a check for that case.",
