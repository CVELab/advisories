            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspufs: fix gang directory lifetimes\n\nprior to \"[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks\" we used to have\na problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns opened\ngang directory, which normally gets removed when that gets closed,\nbut if somebody has created a context belonging to that gang and\nkept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and we\nended up with a leak.\n\nUnfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gang\ndirectory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.\nOne problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()\nas cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was\nin the success case - gang creation incremented link count on\nroot directory, but that was no longer undone when gang got\ndestroyed.\n\nFix consists of\n\t* reverting the commit in question\n\t* adding a counter to gang, protected by ->i_rwsem\nof gang directory inode.\n\t* having it set to 1 at creation time, dropped\nin both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumped\nin spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0.\n\t* using simple_recursive_removal() to take the gang\ndirectory out when counter reaches zero.",
