            "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u191, 7u181, 8u172 and 10.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u171. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via SSL/TLS to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
