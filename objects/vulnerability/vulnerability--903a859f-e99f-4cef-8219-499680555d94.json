            "description": "In Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved an attacker sending certain valid BGP update packets may cause Junos OS Evolved to access an uninitialized pointer causing RPD to core leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of these types of valid BGP update packets will cause an extended Denial of Service condition. RPD will require a restart to recover. An indicator of compromise is to see if the file rpd.re exists by issuing the command: show system core-dumps This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S2-EVO; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2-EVO, 20.1R2-S1-EVO.
