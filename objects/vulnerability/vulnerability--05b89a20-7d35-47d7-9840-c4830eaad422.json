            "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature for Cisco Small Business RV VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
