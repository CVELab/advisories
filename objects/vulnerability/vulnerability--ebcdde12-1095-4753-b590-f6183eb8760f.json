On a machine with the affected ESET product installed, it was possible for a user with lower privileges due to improper privilege management to trigger actions with root privileges.\n\nESET remedied this possible attack vector and has prepared new builds of its products that are no longer susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\n\n\n",
