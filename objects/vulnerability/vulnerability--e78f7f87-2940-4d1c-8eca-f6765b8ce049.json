            "description": "The DNS resolver in unspecified versions of Infoblox DNS One, when resolving recursive DNS queries for arbitrary hosts, allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning via a birthday attack that uses a large number of open queries for the same resource record (RR) combined with spoofed responses, which increases the possibility of successfully spoofing a response in a way that is more efficient than brute force methods.",
