Certain administrative operations in ClearPass Guest do not properly enforce authorization rules, which allows any authenticated administrative user to execute those operations regardless of privilege level. This could allow low-privilege users to view, modify, or delete guest users. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.6 and 6.6.10-hotfix.",
