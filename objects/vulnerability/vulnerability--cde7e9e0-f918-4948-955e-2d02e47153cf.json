            "description": "A low-privileged user is able to obtain information about tasks executed on devices controlled by Proget MDM (Mobile Device Management), as well as details of the devices like their UUIDs needed for exploitation of CVE-2025-1416.\n\nIn order to perform the attack, one has to know a task_id, but since it's a low integer and there is no limit of requests an attacker can perform to a vulnerable endpoint, the task_id might be simply brute forced.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in 2.17.5 version of Konsola Proget (server part of the MDM suite).",
