Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release \nfixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards\n this are welcome.\n\n",
