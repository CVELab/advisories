            "description": "The ShopLentor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_dismiss function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to set arbitrary WordPress options to \"true\". NOTE: This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with subscriber- or customer-level access and above if (1) the WooCommerce plugin is deactivated or (2) access to the default WordPress admin dashboard is explicitly enabled for authenticated users.",
