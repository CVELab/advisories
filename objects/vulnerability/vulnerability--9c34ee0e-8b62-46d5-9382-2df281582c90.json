            "description": "Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.2 in the `/display/map` API route inside the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `bounds` parameter. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5, which fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
