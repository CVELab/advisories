            "description": "A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to copy data from a particular record type into a static-sized buffer within an object that is smaller than the size used for the copy, which will cause a heap-based buffer overflow. In version/Instance 0x0002, an attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability. This affects SoftMaker Software GmbH SoftMaker Office PlanMaker 2021 (Revision 1014).",
