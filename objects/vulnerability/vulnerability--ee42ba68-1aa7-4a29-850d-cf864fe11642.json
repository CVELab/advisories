            "description": "Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with incorrect file permissions (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for Dylib Hijacking.

This issue affects Fast CAD ReaderÂ in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5",
