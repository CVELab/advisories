This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided data that is parsed into system memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the administrator user.",
