            "description": "After Junos OS device reboot or upgrade, the stateless firewall filter configuration may not take effect. This issue can be verified by running the command: user@re0> show interfaces <interface_name> extensive | match filters\" CAM destination filters: 0, CAM source filters: 0 Note: when the issue occurs, it does not show the applied firewall filter.
