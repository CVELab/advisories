            "description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in phpipam version 1.5.2, specifically in the circuits options functionality. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts via the 'option' parameter in the POST request to /phpipam/app/admin/circuits/edit-options-submit.php. The injected script can be executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to potential cookie theft and end-user file disclosure. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.0.",
