            "description": "A vulnerability in the TCP processing engine of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of packets at a high rate through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily disrupt traffic through the device while it reboots.",
