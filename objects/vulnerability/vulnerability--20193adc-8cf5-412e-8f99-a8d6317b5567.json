            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nptdma: pt_core_execute_cmd() should use spinlock\n\nThe interrupt handler (pt_core_irq_handler()) of the ptdma\ndriver can be called from interrupt context. The code flow\nin this function can lead down to pt_core_execute_cmd() which\nwill attempt to grab a mutex, which is not appropriate in\ninterrupt context and ultimately leads to a kernel panic.\nThe fix here changes this mutex to a spinlock, which has\nbeen verified to resolve the issue.",
