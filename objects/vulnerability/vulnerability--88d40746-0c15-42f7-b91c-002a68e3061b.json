            "description": "A Classic Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Smiths Medical Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump, Version 1.1, 1.5, and 1.6. A third-party component used in the pump does not verify input buffer size prior to copying, leading to a buffer overflow, allowing remote code execution on the target device. The pump receives the potentially malicious input infrequently and under certain conditions, increasing the difficulty of exploitation.",
