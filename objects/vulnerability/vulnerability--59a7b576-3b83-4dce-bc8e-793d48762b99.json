The firmware image contains encrypted passwords that are used to authenticate users wishing to access a diagnostics or password-recovery menu. Using the hardcoded cryptographic key found elsewhere in the firmware, these passwords can be decrypted. This is related to fds_sys_passDebugPasswd_ret() and fds_sys_passRecoveryPasswd_ret() in libfds.so.0.0.",
