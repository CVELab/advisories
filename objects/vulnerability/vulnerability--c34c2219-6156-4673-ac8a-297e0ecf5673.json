            "description": "The Defender Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the verify_otp_login_time() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to verify a one time login via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
