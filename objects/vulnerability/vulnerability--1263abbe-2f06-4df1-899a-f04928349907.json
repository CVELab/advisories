The vulnerability is due to insufficient enforcement of the consent token in authorizing shell access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the CLI and requesting shell access on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain shell access on the affected device and execute commands on the underlying OS.",
