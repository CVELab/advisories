            "description": "A vulnerability in the ClearPass Policy Manager web-based management interface exists which exposes some endpoints to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary input against these endpoints if the attacker can convince an authenticated user of the interface to interact with a specially crafted URL in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager version(s): 6.10.x: 6.10.6 and below; 6.9.x: 6.9.11 and below. Aruba has released upgrades for Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager that address this security vulnerability.",
