An attacker could send a link that has a specially crafted URL and convince the user to click the link. When an authenticated user clicks the link, the authenticated user's browser could be redirected to a malicious site that is designed to impersonate a legitimate website. The attacker could trick the user and potentially acquire sensitive information such as the user's credentials.",
