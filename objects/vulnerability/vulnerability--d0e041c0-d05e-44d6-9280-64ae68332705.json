            "description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; third, those contextual tuplesâ€™s user field is an userset; and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.",
