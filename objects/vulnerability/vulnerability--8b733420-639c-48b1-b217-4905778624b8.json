            "description": "A malicious, authenticated user in Aidex, versions prior to 1.7, could list credentials of other users, create or modify existing users in the application, list credentials of users in production or development environments. In addition, it would be possible to cause bugs that would result in the exfiltration of sensitive information, such as details about the software or internal system paths. These actions could be carried out through the misuse of LLM Prompt (chatbot) technology, via the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, by manipulating the contents of the ‘content’ parameter.",
