            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Don't use vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an array index\n\n__vmx_handle_exit() uses vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an index for\nan array access.  Since vcpu->run is (can be) mapped to a user address\nspace with a writer permission, the 'ndata' could be updated by the\nuser process at anytime (the user process can set it to outside the\nbounds of the array).\nSo, it is not safe that __vmx_handle_exit() uses the 'ndata' that way.",
