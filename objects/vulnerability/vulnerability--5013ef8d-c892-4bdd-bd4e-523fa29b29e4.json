            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: core: Add TMF to tmr_list handling\n\nAn abort that is responded to by iSCSI itself is added to tmr_list but does\nnot go to target core. A LUN_RESET that goes through tmr_list takes a\nrefcounter on the abort and waits for completion. However, the abort will\nbe never complete because it was not started in target core.\n\n Unable to locate ITT: 0x05000000 on CID: 0\n Unable to locate RefTaskTag: 0x05000000 on CID: 0.\n wait_for_tasks: Stopping tmf LUN_RESET with tag 0x0 ref_task_tag 0x0 i_state 34 t_state ISTATE_PROCESSING refcnt 2 transport_state active,stop,fabric_stop\n wait for tasks: tmf LUN_RESET with tag 0x0 ref_task_tag 0x0 i_state 34 t_state ISTATE_PROCESSING refcnt 2 transport_state active,stop,fabric_stop\n...\n INFO: task kworker/0:2:49 blocked for more than 491 seconds.\n task:kworker/0:2     state:D stack:    0 pid:   49 ppid:     2 flags:0x00000800\n Workqueue: events target_tmr_work [target_core_mod]\nCall Trace:\n __switch_to+0x2c4/0x470\n _schedule+0x314/0x1730\n schedule+0x64/0x130\n schedule_timeout+0x168/0x430\n wait_for_completion+0x140/0x270\n target_put_cmd_and_wait+0x64/0xb0 [target_core_mod]\n core_tmr_lun_reset+0x30/0xa0 [target_core_mod]\n target_tmr_work+0xc8/0x1b0 [target_core_mod]\n process_one_work+0x2d4/0x5d0\n worker_thread+0x78/0x6c0\n\nTo fix this, only add abort to tmr_list if it will be handled by target\ncore.",
