            "description": "A vulnerability in the management API of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges in the context of the web-based management interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the unintended exposure of sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting the responses from the API. Under certain circumstances, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the API with the privileges of a higher-level user account. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need at least valid Observer credentials.",
