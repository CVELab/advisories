            "description": "Some websites have a feature \"Show Password\" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.",
