            "description": "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload â€“ Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the dnd_codedropz_upload_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete limited arbitrary files on the server. It is not possible to delete files like wp-config.php that would make RCE possible.",
