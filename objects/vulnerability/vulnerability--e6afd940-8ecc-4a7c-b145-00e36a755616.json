            "description": "A vulnerability in which the HTTP web server for Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) has unrestricted directory permissions could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload an arbitrary file. This file could allow the attacker to execute commands at the privilege level of the user prime. This user does not have administrative or root privileges. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect permission setting for important system directories. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file by using TFTP, which can be accessed via the web-interface GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands on the targeted application without authentication.",
