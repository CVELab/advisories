            "description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server. Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.7.0, by trusting that the server will return a certificate that belongs to the keypair of the user, a malicious server could get the desktop client to encrypt files with a key known to the attacker. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop 3.7.0. No known workarounds are available.",
