            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up\n\nThe flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations.\nHowever, this is not necessary, because I2C core already has its own\nlocking for that.\n\nMore importantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in\ni2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler\n(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing\nanything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an\ninfinite loop.\n\nSince interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and the\nflag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up.\n\nDelete this unnecessary flag.",
