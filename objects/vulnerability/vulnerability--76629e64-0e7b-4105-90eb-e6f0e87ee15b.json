            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events\n\nAD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with\nthe ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying\nuser space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit\nregisters or above the values set in high limit registers.\nHowever, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callback\nfunctions must be implemented and those were not present until now.\nThe consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the\nproper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel\nbecause the pointers to the callback functions were not set.\n\nImplement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write\nevent thresholds and enable/disable event generation.\n\nSince the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also move\nthose from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused\nwhen support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.",
