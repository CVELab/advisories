            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregmap: maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop()\n\nWhen keeping the upper end of a cache block entry, the entry[] array\nmust be indexed by the offset from the base register of the block,\ni.e. max - mas.index.\n\nThe code was indexing entry[] by only the register address, leading\nto an out-of-bounds access that copied some part of the kernel\nmemory over the cache contents.\n\nThis bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it only\ntests with a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.",
