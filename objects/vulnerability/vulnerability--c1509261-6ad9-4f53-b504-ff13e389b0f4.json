            "description": "In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350648, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p9, 11.3-STABLE before r350650, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p2, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p13, the ICMPv6 input path incorrectly handles cases where an MLDv2 listener query packet is internally fragmented across multiple mbufs. A remote attacker may be able to cause an out-of-bounds read or write that may cause the kernel to attempt to access an unmapped page and subsequently panic.",
