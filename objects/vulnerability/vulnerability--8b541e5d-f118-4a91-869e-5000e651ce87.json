An attacker logs in to the system as a common user and sends crafted HTTP requests that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. Due to a lack of input validation on HTTP requests that contain user-supplied input, successful exploitation may allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
