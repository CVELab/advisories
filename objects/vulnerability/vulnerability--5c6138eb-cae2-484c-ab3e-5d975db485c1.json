            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: prevent reg-wait speculations\n\nWith *ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG instead of passing a user pointer with arguments\nfor the waiting loop the user can specify an offset into a pre-mapped\nregion of memory, in which case the\n[offset, offset + sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait)) will be intepreted as the\nargument.\n\nAs we address a kernel array using a user given index, it'd be a subject\nto speculation type of exploits. Use array_index_nospec() to prevent\nthat. Make sure to pass not the full region size but truncate by the\nmaximum offset allowed considering the structure size.",
