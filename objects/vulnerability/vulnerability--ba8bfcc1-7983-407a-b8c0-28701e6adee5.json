            "description": "WOWS Karma is a reputation system for Wargaming's World of Warships. A user is able to click multiple times on \"create\" on a post creation prompt before the modal closes, which triggers sending several post creation API requests at once. Due to timing, sending multiple posts simultaneously requests bypasses the cooldown validation, however are not refreshing a user's metrics more than once, due to concurrent karma updates. This issue is fixed in 0.17.4.1.",
