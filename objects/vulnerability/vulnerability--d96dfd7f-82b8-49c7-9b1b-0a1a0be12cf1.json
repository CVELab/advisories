            "description": "The Royal Elementor Kit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary transient update due to a missing capability check on the dismissed_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.116. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to update arbitrary transients. Note, that these transients can only be updated to true and not arbitrary values.",
