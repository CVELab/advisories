            "description": "A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a privilege escalation in which one virtual domain user can view and modify another virtual domain configuration. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly enforce RBAC for virtual domains. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an authenticated, crafted HTTP request to a targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass RBAC policies on the targeted system to modify a virtual domain and access resources that are not normally accessible. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg36875.",
