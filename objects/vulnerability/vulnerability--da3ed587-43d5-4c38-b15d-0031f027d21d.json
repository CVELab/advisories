            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf\n\niavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which\niavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function\ncalls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the\ninterface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF\ncommunication is restored.",
