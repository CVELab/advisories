            "description": "A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.",
