            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npage_pool: avoid infinite loop to schedule delayed worker\n\nWe noticed the kworker in page_pool_release_retry() was waken\nup repeatedly and infinitely in production because of the\nbuggy driver causing the inflight less than 0 and warning\nus in page_pool_inflight()[1].\n\nSince the inflight value goes negative, it means we should\nnot expect the whole page_pool to get back to work normally.\n\nThis patch mitigates the adverse effect by not rescheduling\nthe kworker when detecting the inflight negative in\npage_pool_release_retry().\n\n[1]\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] Negative(-51446) inflight packet-pages\n...\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] Call Trace:\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  page_pool_release_retry+0x23/0x70\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  process_one_work+0x1b1/0x370\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  worker_thread+0x37/0x3a0\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  kthread+0x11a/0x140\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ? process_one_work+0x370/0x370\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ? __kthread_cancel_work+0x40/0x40\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025]  ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n[Mon Feb 10 20:36:11 2025] ---[ end trace ebffe800f33e7e34 ]---\nNote: before this patch, the above calltrace would flood the\ndmesg due to repeated reschedule of release_dw kworker.",
