            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data in a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web-based management interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
