            "description": "An exploitable integer-overflow vulnerability exists within Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML, it will attempt to convert each character from a font into a polygon and then attempt to rasterize these shapes. As the application attempts to iterate through the rows and initializing the polygon shape in the buffer, it will write outside of the bounds of said buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running it.",
