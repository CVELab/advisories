            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_task\n\nCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before we\nhandle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due to\ntimeout.\n\nWhen the timeout occurs, the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and the\nsas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().\n\nHowever, if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion still\nthinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb->task\nif the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if this\npointer is cleared.",
