            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to a targeted device with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control for certain URLs on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting specific URLs from an affected AP. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the device with elevated privileges. While the attacker would not be granted access to all possible configuration options, it could allow the attacker to view sensitive information and replace some options with values of their choosing, including wireless network configuration. It would also allow the attacker to disable the AP, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition for clients associated with the AP.",
