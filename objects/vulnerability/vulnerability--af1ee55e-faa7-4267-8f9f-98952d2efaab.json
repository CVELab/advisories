            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands and obtain root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) function of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CSR in the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the device with full root privileges.",
