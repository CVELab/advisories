The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented configuration commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing specific steps that make the hidden commands accessible. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make configuration changes to various sections of an affected device that should not be exposed to CLI access.",
