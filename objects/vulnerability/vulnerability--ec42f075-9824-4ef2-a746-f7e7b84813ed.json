            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay\n\nThis mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd (\"ext4: remove redundant\nmb_regenerate_buddy()\") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based on\ncode in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as free\nblocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the\nbuddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.",
