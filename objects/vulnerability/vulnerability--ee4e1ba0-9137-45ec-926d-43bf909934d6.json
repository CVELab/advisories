            "description": "io_uring uses work_flags to determine which identity need to grab from the calling process to make sure it is consistent with the calling process when executing IORING_OP. The mapping of flags is incomplete, which leads to multiple incorrect reference counts and hence use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit df3f3bb5059d20ef094d6b2f0256c4bf4127a859",
