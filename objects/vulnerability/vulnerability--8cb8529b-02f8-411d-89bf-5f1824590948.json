            "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure FTP (SFTP) of Cisco StarOS for Cisco ASR 5000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of symbolic links. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SFTP command to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the affected device.",
