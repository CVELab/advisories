            "description": "Voltronic Power ViewPower USBCommEx shutdown Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that an administrator must trigger a shutdown operation.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the shutdown method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-22071.",
