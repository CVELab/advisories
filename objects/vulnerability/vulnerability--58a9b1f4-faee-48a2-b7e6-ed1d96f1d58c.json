The vulnerability is limited to the Dell Firmware Update Utility during the time window while being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low-privileged malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into overwriting arbitrary files via a symlink attack. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the update utility delivers.",
