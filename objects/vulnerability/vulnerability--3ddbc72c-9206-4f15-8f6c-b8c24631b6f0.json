If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for\nthe interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying\nto acquire the same mutex.\n\nCPU0                           CPU1\n----                           ----\nmcp251x_open()\n mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)\n  request_threaded_irq()\n                               <interrupt>\n                               mcp251x_can_ist()\n                                mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)\n  mcp251x_hw_wake()\n   disable_irq() <-- deadlock\n\nUse disable_irq_nosync() instead because the interrupt handler does\neverything while holding the mutex so it doesn't matter if it's still\nrunning.",
