            "description": "A flaw was found in grub2. The calculation of the translation buffer when reading a language .mo file in grub_gettext_getstr_from_position() may overflow, leading to a Out-of-bound write. This issue can be leveraged by an attacker to overwrite grub2's sensitive heap data, eventually leading to the circumvention of secure boot protections.",
