This vulnerability is due to improper handling of large series of message requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of messages to the vulnerable API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, dropping all ongoing calls and resulting in a DoS condition.",
