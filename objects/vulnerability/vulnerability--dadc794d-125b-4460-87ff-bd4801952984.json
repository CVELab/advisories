            "description": "1E Client installer can perform arbitrary file deletion on protected files.  \n\nA non-privileged user could provide a symbolic link or Windows junction to point to a protected directory in the installer that the 1E Client would then clear on service startup. A hotfix is available Q23092 that forces the 1E Client to check for a symbolic link or junction and if it finds one refuses to use that path and instead creates a path involving a random GUID.\n\n",
