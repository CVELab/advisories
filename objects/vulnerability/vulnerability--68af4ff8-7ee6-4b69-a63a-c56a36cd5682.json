            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup\n\nCommit a70f9fe52daa (\"xfs: detect and handle invalid iclog size set by\nmkfs\") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initial\numount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9\n(\"xfs: clean up calculation of LR header blocks\") cleaned up the log\nreover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size value\nto size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of bounds\naccess when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs\ntool, but a fuzzer.\n\nFix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size\ninto account for this calculation.",
