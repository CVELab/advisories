            "description": "TP-Link TL-WR841N ated_tp Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR841N routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the ated_tp service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21825.",
