            "description": "A deserialization vulnerability in a .NET framework class used and not properly checked by Flexi Soft Designer in all versions up to and including 1.9.4 SP1 allows an attacker to craft malicious project files. Opening/importing such a malicious project file would execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user when opened or imported by the Flexi Soft Designer. This compromises confidentiality integrity and availability. For the attack to succeed a user must manually open a malicious project file.",
