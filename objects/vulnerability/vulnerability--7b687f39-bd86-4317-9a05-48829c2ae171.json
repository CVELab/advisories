            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()\n\nethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and\n.set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is\nbuggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver\nprovides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer\ndereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.\n\nFix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is\nensured. This also matches the netlink code.\n\nNote that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the\nlegacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:\n- have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no\n .set_coalesce(), or\n- have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't\n  cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()\n  and bails out on error.",
