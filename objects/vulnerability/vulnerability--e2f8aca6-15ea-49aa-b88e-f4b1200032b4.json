            "description": "The LadiApp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the publish_lp() function hooked via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 4.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to change the LadiPage key (a key fully controlled by the attacker), enabling them to freely create new pages, including web pages that trigger stored XSS",
