            "description": "An attacker with physical access to Moxa's bootloader versions of UC-8580 Series V1.1, UC-8540 Series V1.0 to V1.2, UC-8410A Series V2.2, UC-8200 Series V1.0 to V2.4, UC-8100A-ME-T Series V1.0 to V1.1, UC-8100 Series V1.2 to V1.3, UC-5100 Series V1.2, UC-3100 Series V1.2 to V2.0, UC-2100 Series V1.3 to V1.5, and UC-2100-W Series V1.3 to V1.5 can initiate a restart of the device and gain access to its BIOS. Command line options can then be altered, allowing the attacker to access the terminal. From the terminal, the attacker can modify the deviceâ€™s authentication files to create a new user and gain full access to the system.",
