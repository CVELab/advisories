The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the module that handles character codes for certain textual representations. Invalid input leads to a computation where the pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.",
