            "description": "A vulnerability in the configuration restore feature of Cisco Nexus Data Broker software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of configuration backup files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an administrator to restore a crafted configuration backup file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files that are accessible through the affected software on an affected device.",
