A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may be able to exploit this issue to crash the virtual machine's vmx process leading to a denial of service condition or execute code on the hypervisor from a virtual machine. Additional conditions beyond the attacker's control must be present for exploitation to be possible.",
