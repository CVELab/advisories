            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/imagination: take paired job reference\n\nFor paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the\ngeometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until\nthe fragment job has finished with it.\n\nThe geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being\nprepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the\ngeometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.\n\nFixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:\n\n[  124.256386] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pvr_queue_prepare_job+0x108/0x868 [powervr]\n[  124.264893] Read of size 1 at addr ffff0000084cb960 by task kworker/u16:4/63",
