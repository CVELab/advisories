            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI configuration shell of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands as the root user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the execution of a vulnerable CLI command. An attacker with administrator-level credentials could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted arguments during command execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary code execution as root on an affected product.",
