            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: idxd: Convert spinlock to mutex to lock evl workqueue\n\ndrain_workqueue() cannot be called safely in a spinlocked context due to\npossible task rescheduling. In the multi-task scenario, calling\nqueue_work() while drain_workqueue() will lead to a Call Trace as\npushing a work on a draining workqueue is not permitted in spinlocked\ncontext.\n    Call Trace:\n    <TASK>\n    ? __warn+0x7d/0x140\n    ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440\n    ? report_bug+0x1f8/0x200\n    ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n    ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70\n    ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n    ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440\n    queue_work_on+0x28/0x30\n    idxd_misc_thread+0x303/0x5a0 [idxd]\n    ? __schedule+0x369/0xb40\n    ? __pfx_irq_thread_fn+0x10/0x10\n    ? irq_thread+0xbc/0x1b0\n    irq_thread_fn+0x21/0x70\n    irq_thread+0x102/0x1b0\n    ? preempt_count_add+0x74/0xa0\n    ? __pfx_irq_thread_dtor+0x10/0x10\n    ? __pfx_irq_thread+0x10/0x10\n    kthread+0x103/0x140\n    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n    ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50\n    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n    </TASK>\n\nThe current implementation uses a spinlock to protect event log workqueue\nand will lead to the Call Trace due to potential task rescheduling.\n\nTo address the locking issue, convert the spinlock to mutex, allowing\nthe drain_workqueue() to be called in a safe mutex-locked context.\n\nThis change ensures proper synchronization when accessing the event log\nworkqueue, preventing potential Call Trace and improving the overall\nrobustness of the code.",
