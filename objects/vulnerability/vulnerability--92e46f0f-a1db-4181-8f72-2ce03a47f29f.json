            "description": "Metabase is data visualization software. Prior to versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9, custom GeoJSON map URL address would follow redirects to addresses that were otherwise disallowed, like link-local or private-network. This issue is patched in versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9. Metabase no longer follow redirects on GeoJSON map URLs. An environment variable `MB_CUSTOM_GEOJSON_ENABLED` was also added to disable custom GeoJSON completely (`true` by default).",
