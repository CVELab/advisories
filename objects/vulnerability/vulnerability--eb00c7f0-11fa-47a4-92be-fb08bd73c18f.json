            "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, 6 through Update 38, and 5.0 through Update 38, and OpenJDK 6 and 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to CORBA.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue involves the creation of a single PresentationManager that is shared across multiple thread groups, which allows remote attackers to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
