The application deserialises untrusted data without sufficient validations, that could result in an arbitrary deserialization. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code in the affected system. The CCOM communication component used for Windows App / Click-Once and IE Web / XBAP client connectivity are affected by the vulnerability.",
