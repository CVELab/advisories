            "description": "OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. In versions up to and including 1.10.3, OctoPrint has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass the login redirect and directly access the rendered HTML of certain frontend pages. The primary risk lies in potential future modifications to the codebase that might incorrectly rely on the vulnerable internal functions for authentication checks, leading to security vulnerabilities. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.0.",
