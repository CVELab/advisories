            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix request.queuelist usage in flush\n\nFriedrich Weber reported a kernel crash problem and bisected to commit\n81ada09cc25e (\"blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist in flush state machine\").\n\nThe root cause is that we use \"list_move_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)\"\nin the PREFLUSH/POSTFLUSH sequences. But rq->queuelist.next == xxx since\nit's popped out from plug->cached_rq in __blk_mq_alloc_requests_batch().\nWe don't initialize its queuelist just for this first request, although\nthe queuelist of all later popped requests will be initialized.\n\nFix it by changing to use \"list_add_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)\" so\nrq->queuelist doesn't need to be initialized. It should be ok since rq\ncan't be on any list when PREFLUSH or POSTFLUSH, has no move actually.\n\nPlease note the commit 81ada09cc25e (\"blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist in\nflush state machine\") also has another requirement that no drivers would\ntouch rq->queuelist after blk_mq_end_request() since we will reuse it to\nadd rq to the post-flush pending list in POSTFLUSH. If this is not true,\nwe will have to revert that commit IMHO.\n\nThis updated version adds \"list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)\" in flush rq\ncallback since the dm layer may submit request of a weird invalid format\n(REQ_FSEQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH), which causes double list_add\nif without this \"list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)\". The weird invalid format\nproblem should be fixed in dm layer.",
