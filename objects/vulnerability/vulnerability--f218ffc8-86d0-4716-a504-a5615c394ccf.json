            "description": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS allows for a remote unauthenticated user to upload temporary files through the management web interface that are not properly deleted after the request is finished. It is possible for an attacker to disrupt the availability of the management web interface by repeatedly uploading files until available disk space is exhausted. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.16; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.10; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.",
