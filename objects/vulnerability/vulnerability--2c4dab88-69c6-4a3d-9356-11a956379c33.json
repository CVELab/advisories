The web interface could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to modify content of particular web pages, causing the application to behave in unexpected ways for legitimate users. Successful exploitation does not require for an attacker to be authenticated to the web interface. This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents of the web application. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security. vulnerability was known.",
